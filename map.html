The park is divided by the Serpentine and the Long Water lakes.\nThe park was established by Henry VIII in 1536 when he took the land from Westminster Abbey and used it as a hunting ground. It opened to the public in 1637 and quickly became popular, particularly for May Day parades. Major improvements occurred in the early 18th century under the direction of Queen Caroline. Several duels took place in Hyde Park during this time, often involving members of the nobility. The Great Exhibition of 1851 was held in the park, for which The Crystal Palace, designed by Joseph Paxton, was erected.\nFree speech and demonstrations have been a key feature of Hyde Park since the 19th century. Speakers' Corner has been established as a point of free speech and debate since 1872, while the Chartists, the Reform League, the suffragettes, and the Stop the War Coalition have all held protests there. In the late 20th century, the park was known for holding large-scale free rock music concerts, featuring groups such as Pink Floyd, The Rolling Stones and Queen. Major events in the park have continued into the 21st century, such as Live 8 in 2005, and the annual Hyde Park Winter Wonderland from 2007.", "images": ["https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/f/f3/Hyde_Park_London_from_the_air.jpg", "https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/4/4f/Pissarro_Hyde_Park.jpg", "https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/e/ea/Police_Station%2C_Hyde_Park_-_geograph.org.uk_-_218746.jpg", "https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/8/87/Aerial_view_of_Hyde_Park.jpg", "https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/d/d7/%27FREE_HUGS%27%2C_Speaker%27s_Corner%2C_Hyde_Park%2C_London.jpg", "https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/f/f4/Cmglee_London_Speakers_Corner_aerial.jpg", "https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/f/f7/Hyde_Park_London_from_1833_Schmollinger_map.jpg", "https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/9/9a/Pink_floyd_live_8_london.jpg", "https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/7/71/7_7_Hyde_Park_090712.jpg", "https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/c/c5/Rima%2C_the_Hudson_memorial.jpg", "https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/0/07/Speaker%27s_Corner_Speaker.jpg", "https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/2/20/James_Douglas%2C_4th_Duke_of_Hamilton%3B_Charles_Mohun%2C_4th_Baron_Mohun_from_NPG.jpg", "https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/9/94/Wellington_Arch_-_01.jpg", "https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/9/9a/Winter_Wonderland_5276970971.jpg", "https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/c/ce/London_2012_Olympic_Stadium_%2813_July_2012%29.jpg"], "near": ["Tyburn%20Brook", "Eia", "Triathlon%20at%20the%202012%20Summer%20Olympics", "Women%27s%20Sunday", "Kronenburgerpark", "Great%20Pilgrimage", "Hyde%20Park%2C%20London", "Rotten%20Row", "Dell%20Restaurant", "2011%20London%20anti-cuts%20protest"], "lat": 51.5072682, "lon": -0.1657303, "maps": "https://maps.google.com/?q=51.5072682,-0.1657303", "citymapper": "https://citymapper.com/directions?endcoord=51.5072682%2C-0.1657303&endname=Hyde%20Park"}));

Located in the City of Westminster, the palace is often at the centre of state occasions and royal hospitality. It has been a focal point for the British people at times of national rejoicing and mourning.\nOriginally known as Buckingham House, the building at the core of today's palace was a large townhouse built for the Duke of Buckingham in 1703 on a site that had been in private ownership for at least 150 years. It was acquired by King George III in 1761 as a private residence for Queen Charlotte and became known as The Queen's House. During the 19th century it was enlarged by architects John Nash and Edward Blore, who constructed three wings around a central courtyard. Buckingham Palace became the London residence of the British monarch on the accession of Queen Victoria in 1837.\nThe last major structural additions were made in the late 19th and early 20th centuries, including the East Front, which contains the well-known balcony on which the British royal family traditionally congregates to greet crowds. A German bomb destroyed the palace chapel during the Second World War; the Queen's Gallery was built on the site and opened to the public in 1962 to exhibit works of art from the Royal Collection.\nThe original early-19th-century interior designs, many of which survive, include widespread use of brightly coloured scagliola and blue and pink lapis, on the advice of Sir Charles Long. King Edward VII oversaw a partial redecoration in a Belle \u00c9poque cream and gold colour scheme. Many smaller reception rooms are furnished in the Chinese regency style with furniture and fittings brought from the Royal Pavilion at Brighton and from Carlton House.

Along with the adjoining Cabinet Office at 70 Whitehall, it is the headquarters of the Government of the United Kingdom.\nSituated in Downing Street in the City of Westminster, London, Number 10 is over 300 years old and contains approximately 100 rooms. A private residence for the prime minister's use occupies the third floor and there is a kitchen in the basement. The other floors contain offices and conference, reception, sitting and dining rooms where the prime minister works, and where government ministers, national leaders and foreign dignitaries are met and hosted. At the rear is an interior courtyard and a terrace overlooking a 1\u20442 acre (0.2 ha) garden. Adjacent to St James's Park, Number 10 is approximately 3\u20444 mile (1.2 km) from Buckingham Palace, the London residence of the British Monarch, and near the Palace of Westminster, the meeting place of both Houses of Parliament.\nOriginally three houses, Number 10 was offered to Sir Robert Walpole by King George II in 1732. Walpole accepted on the condition that the gift was to the office of First Lord of the Treasury. The post of First Lord of the Treasury has, for much of the 18th and 19th centuries and invariably since 1905, been held by the Prime Minister. Walpole commissioned William Kent to join the three houses and it is this larger house that is known as Number 10 Downing Street.\nDespite its size and convenient location near to Parliament, few early prime ministers lived at 10 Downing Street.

Since the coronation of William the Conqueror in 1066, all coronations of English and British monarchs have occurred in Westminster Abbey. Sixteen royal weddings have occurred at the Abbey since 1100.According to a tradition first reported by Sulcard in about 1080, a church was founded at the site (then known as Thorn Ey (Thorn Island)) in the seventh century at the time of Mellitus, a Bishop of London. Construction of the present church began in 1245 on the orders of King Henry III.The church was originally part of a Catholic Benedictine abbey, which was dissolved in 1539. It then served as the cathedral of the Diocese of Westminster until 1550, then as a second cathedral of the Diocese of London until 1556. The abbey was restored to the Benedictines by Mary I in 1556, then in 1559 made a royal peculiar\u2014a church responsible directly to the sovereign\u2014by Queen Elizabeth I.\nThe Abbey is the burial site of more than 3,300 people, usually of prominence in British history: at least 16 monarchs, eight prime ministers, poets laureate, actors, scientists, military leaders, and the Unknown Warrior\u2014the first person interred in the Abbey's Poets' Corner was Geoffrey Chaucer in 1400.", "images": ["https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/f/f0/Westminster_Abbey_The_Sanctuary_London_1.jpg", "https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/3/3d/SanktEdvardsstol_westminster.jpg", "https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/9/9c/Westminster_Abbey_Choir.jpg", "https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/8/81/London_UK_Interior-of-Westminster-Abbey-02.jpg", "https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/8/8b/Westminster_Abbey_St_Peter.jpg", "https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/c/c0/London_-_Westminster_abbey_-_chapter_house_04.jpg", "https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/7/7f/London_UK_West-Cloister-of-Westminster-Abbey-01.jpg", "https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/0/00/Westminster_Abbey_c1711.jpg", "https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/7/78/London_westminster_1894.jpg", "https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/c/c0/Giovanni_Antonio_Canal%2C_il_Canaletto_-_London_-_Westminster_Abbey%2C_with_a_Procession_of_Knights_of_the_Bath_-_WGA03950.jpg", "https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/4/46/Diana%27s_funeral.jpg", "https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/1/1f/Replica_of_the_Stone_of_Scone%2C_Scone_Palace%2C_Scotland_%288924541883%29.jpg", "https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/a/a6/Stonehenge-Green.jpg", "https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/1/19/BayeuxTapestryScene26.jpg", "https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/d/d1/Richard2_Anna.jpg", "https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/f/fd/Fanning_Ribbed_Arch_%2889754701%29.jpeg"], "near": ["Funeral%20of%20Diana%2C%20Princess%20of%20Wales", "The%20Unknown%20Warrior", "Westminster%20Abbey", "Christopher%20Monck%2C%202nd%20Duke%20of%20Albemarle", "Poets%27%20Corner", "Henry%20VII%20Chapel", "Close%20of%20the%20Collegiate%20Church%20of%20St%20Peter", "Westminster%20Abbey%20Muniments", "Field%20of%20Remembrance", "City%20and%20Liberty%20of%20Westminster"], "lat": 51.4993695, "lon": -0.1272993, "maps": "https://maps.google.com/?q=51.4993695,-0.1272993", "citymapper": "https://citymapper.com/directions?endcoord=51.4993695%2C-0.1272993&endname=Westminster%20Abbey"}));

It was built between 1365 and 1366, under the direction of William of Sleaford and Henry de Yevele, to house the personal treasure of King Edward III. The original tower was a three-storey, crenellated stone building which occupied a secluded part of the palace and was protected by a moat linked to the River Thames. The ground floor featured elaborate sculpted vaulting, described by historian Jeremy Ashbee as \"an architectural masterpiece\". The tower continued to be used for storing the monarch's treasure and personal possessions until 1512, when a fire in the palace caused King Henry VIII to relocate his court to the nearby Palace of Whitehall.\nAt the end of the 16th century the House of Lords began to use the tower to store its parliamentary records, building a house alongside it for the use of the parliamentary clerk, and extensive improvements followed in 1621. The tower continued as the Lords' records office through the 18th century and several renovations were carried out to improve its fire-proofing and comfort, creating the present appearance of the tower. It was one of only four buildings to survive the burning of Parliament in 1834, after which the records were moved to the Victoria Tower, built for the purpose of storing archives, and part of the new neo-Gothic Palace of Westminster.\nIn 1869 the Jewel Tower was taken over by the newly formed Standard Weights and Measures Department, which used it for storing and testing official weights and measures. The rising level of passing vehicular traffic made the tower increasingly unsuitable for this work, and by 1938 the department had abandoned it in favour of other facilities. In 1948 the building was placed into the care of the Ministry of Works, which repaired the damage inflicted to the tower during the Second World War and restored the building extensively, clearing the surrounding area and opening the tower to tourists. Today the Jewel Tower is managed by English Heritage and receives about 30,000 visitors annually.", "images": ["https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/b/b4/Jewel_Tower.jpg", "https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/0/08/Plan_of_the_Jewel_Tower.jpg", "https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/d/db/Foundations_of_the_Jewel_Tower.jpg", "https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/7/73/Carving_at_Jewel_Tower.jpg", "https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/3/3b/Detail_of_1621_door_in_the_Jewel_Tower.jpg", "https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/7/7e/Jewel_Tower%2C_north-west%2C_1807.jpg", "https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/b/be/Vaulted_ceiling_of_the_Jewel_Tower.jpg", "https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/8/8c/College_Green%2C_Westminster.jpg", "https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/6/64/Exhibits_at_the_Jewel_Tower.jpg", "https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/0/09/Weights_and_Measures_room_at_the_Jewel_Tower%2C_1897.jpg", "https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/7/7e/Jewel_Tower%2C_south-west%2C_1807.jpg", "https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/1/1d/Old_Palace_Yard%2C_Westminster%2C_1720.jpg"], "near": ["Jewel%20Tower", "Parliamentary%20Estate", "Statue%20of%20George%20V%2C%20Westminster", "Parliamentary%20Archives", "White%20Chamber", "Imperial%20Monumental%20Halls%20and%20Tower", "Richard%20Coeur%20de%20Lion%20%28statue%29", "College%20Green%2C%20London", "Old%20Palace%20Yard", "Painted%20Chamber"], "lat": 51.4985928, "lon": -0.1260911, "maps": "https://maps.google.com/?q=51.4985928,-0.1260911", "citymapper": "https://citymapper.com/directions?endcoord=51.4985928%2C-0.1260911&endname=Jewel%20Tower"}));

Informally known as the Houses of Parliament, the Palace lies on the north bank of the River Thames in the City of Westminster, in central London, England.\nIts name, which derives from the neighbouring Westminster Abbey, may refer to several historic structures but most often: the Old Palace, a medieval building-complex largely destroyed by fire in 1834, or its replacement, the New Palace that stands today.  The palace is owned by the Crown. Committees appointed by both houses manage the building and report to the Speaker of the House of Commons and to the Lord Speaker.\nThe first royal palace constructed on the site dated from the 11th century, and Westminster became the primary residence of the Kings of England until fire destroyed the royal apartments in 1512 (after which, the nearby Palace of Whitehall was established). The remainder of Westminster continued to serve as the home of the Parliament of England, which had met there since the 13th century, and also as the seat of the Royal Courts of Justice, based in and around Westminster Hall. In 1834 an even greater fire ravaged the heavily rebuilt Houses of Parliament, and the only significant medieval structures to survive were Westminster Hall, the Cloisters of St Stephen's, the Chapel of St Mary Undercroft, and the Jewel Tower.\nIn the subsequent competition for the reconstruction of the Palace, the architect Charles Barry won with a design for new buildings in the Gothic Revival style, specifically inspired by the English Perpendicular Gothic style of the 14th\u201316th centuries. The remains of the Old Palace (except the detached Jewel Tower) were incorporated into its much larger replacement, which contains over 1,100 rooms organised symmetrically around two series of courtyards and which has a floor area of 112,476 m2 (1,210,680 sq ft). Part of the New Palace's area of 3.24 hectares (8 acres) was reclaimed from the River Thames, which is the setting of its nearly 300-metre long (980 ft) fa\u00e7ade, called the River Front. Augustus Pugin, a leading authority on Gothic architecture and style, assisted Barry and designed the interior of the Palace. Construction started in 1840 and lasted for 30 years, suffering great delays and cost overruns, as well as the death of both leading architects; works for the interior decoration continued intermittently well into the 20th century. Major conservation work has taken place since then to reverse the effects of London's air pollution, and extensive repairs followed the Second World War, including the simplified reconstruction of the Commons Chamber following its bombing in 1941.\nThe Palace is one of the centres of political life in the United Kingdom; \"Westminster\" has become a metonym for the UK Parliament and the British Government, and the Westminster system of government commemorates the name of the palace. The Elizabeth Tower, in particular, often referred to by the name of its main bell, Big Ben, has become an iconic landmark of London and of the United Kingdom in general, one of the most popular tourist attractions in the city, and an emblem of parliamentary democracy. Tsar Nicholas I of Russia called the new palace \"a dream in stone\". The Palace of Westminster has been a Grade I listed building since 1970 and part of a UNESCO World Heritage Site since 1987.", "images":

The official name of the tower in which Big Ben is located was originally the Clock Tower, but it was renamed Elizabeth Tower in 2012 to mark the Diamond Jubilee of Elizabeth II.\nThe tower was designed by Augustus Pugin in a neo-Gothic style. When completed in 1859, its clock was the largest and most accurate four-faced striking and chiming clock in the world. The tower stands 316 feet (96 m) tall, and the climb from ground level to the belfry is 334 steps. Its base is square, measuring 40 feet (12 m) on each side. Dials of the clock are 22.5 feet (6.9 m) in diameter. All four nations of the UK are represented on the tower on shields featuring a rose for England, thistle for Scotland, shamrock for Ireland, and leek for Wales. On 31 May 2009, celebrations were held to mark the tower's 150th anniversary.Big Ben is the largest of the tower's five bells and weighs 13.5 long tons (13.7 tonnes; 15.1 short tons). It was the largest bell in the United Kingdom for 23 years. The origin of the bell's nickname is open to question; it may be named after Sir Benjamin Hall, who oversaw its installation, or heavyweight boxing champion Benjamin Caunt. Four quarter bells chime at 15, 30 and 45 minutes past the hour and just before Big Ben tolls on the hour. The clock uses its original Victorian mechanism, but an electric motor can be used as a backup.\nThe tower is a British cultural icon recognised all over the world. It is one of the most prominent symbols of the United Kingdom and parliamentary democracy, and it is often used in the establishing shot of films set in London. The clock tower has been part of a Grade I listed building since 1970 and a UNESCO World Heritage Site since 1987.\nOn 21 August 2017, a four-year schedule of renovation works began on the tower. Modifications have included adding a lift, re-glazing and repainting the clock dials, and upgrading lighting and repairing roof tiles among other improvements.

The current crossing, which opened to traffic in 1973, is a box girder bridge built from concrete and steel. It replaced a 19th-century stone-arched bridge, which in turn superseded a 600-year-old stone-built medieval structure. This was preceded by a succession of timber bridges, the first of which was built by the Roman founders of London.\nThe current bridge stands at the western end of the Pool of London and is positioned 30 metres (98 ft) upstream from previous alignments. The approaches to the medieval bridge were marked by the church of St Magnus-the-Martyr on the northern bank and by Southwark Cathedral on the southern shore. Until Putney Bridge opened in 1729, London Bridge was the only road crossing of the Thames downstream of Kingston upon Thames. London Bridge has been depicted in its several forms, in art, literature, and songs, including the nursery rhyme \"London Bridge Is Falling Down\", and the epic poem The Waste Land by T. S. Eliot.\nThe modern bridge is owned and maintained by Bridge House Estates, an independent charity of medieval origin overseen by the City of London Corporation.

It became more down-market in the late 18th century as Leicester House was demolished and retail developments took place, becoming a centre for entertainment. Several major theatres were built in the 19th century, which were converted to cinemas towards the middle of the next. Leicester Square is the location of nationally significant cinemas such as the Odeon Leicester Square, Empire, Leicester Square, which are often used for film premieres (and the now closed Odeon West End). The nearby Prince Charles Cinema is known for its screenings of cult films and marathon film runs. The square remains a tourist attraction which hosts events, including for the Chinese New Year.\nThe square has always had a park in its centre, which was originally Common land. The park's fortunes have varied over the centuries, reaching near dilapidation in the mid-19th century after changing ownership several times. It was restored under the direction of Albert Grant, which included the construction of four new statues and a fountain of William Shakespeare. The square was extensively refurbished and remodelled for the 2012 London Olympics at a cost of more than \u00a315 million, taking over 17 months to complete.", "images": ["https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/3/30/Charlie_Chaplin-Leicester_Square-London.jpg", "https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/e/e4/Redeveloped_Leicester_Square.jpg", "https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/2/22/Leicester_Square_c1880.jpg", "https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/4/4e/Panorama_showing_the_Lego_Store_and_M%26M%27s_world_in_Leicester_Square%2C_London.jpg", "https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/2/2d/Leicester_Square_in_September_2016.jpg", "https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/1/1c/Ticket_Booth%2C_Leicester_Square_W1_-_geograph.org.uk_-_1284462.jpg", "https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/8/8e/Leicester_Square_with_the_Alhambra_formerly_the_Royal_Panopticon_ILN_1874.jpg", "https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/6/60/Statue_of_Mr._Bean_at_Leicester_Square.jpg", "https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/5/53/Londen_2006_%28361%29_%282848925508%29.jpg"], "near": ["Home%20%28nightclub%29", "Empire%2C%20Leicester%20Square", "Kinky%20Gerlinky", "Swiss%20Centre%2C%20London", "Wyld%27s%20Great%20Globe", "Leicester%20Square%20Theatre", "Leicester%20Square", "Statue%20of%20William%20Shakespeare%2C%20Leicester%20Square", "Scenes%20in%20the%20Square", "Leicester%20House%2C%20Westminster"], "lat": 51.510676, "lon": -0.1306432, "maps": "https://maps.google.com/?q=51.510676,-0.1306432", "citymapper": "https://citymapper.com/directions?endcoord=51.510676%2C-0.1306432&endname=Leicester%20Square"}));

Originally a fashionable district for the aristocracy, it has been one of the main entertainment districts in the capital since the 19th century.\nThe area was developed from farmland by Henry VIII in 1536, when it became a royal park. It became a parish in its own right in the late 17th century, when buildings started to be developed for the upper class, including the laying out of Soho Square in the 1680s. St Anne's Church was established during the late 17th century, and remains a significant local landmark; other churches are the Church of Our Lady of the Assumption and St Gregory and St Patrick's Church in Soho Square. The aristocracy had mostly moved away by the mid-19th century, when Soho was particularly badly hit by an outbreak of cholera in 1854. For much of the 20th century Soho had a reputation as a base for the sex industry in addition to its night life and its location for the headquarters of leading film companies. Since the 1980s, the area has undergone considerable gentrification. It is now predominantly a fashionable district of upmarket restaurants and media offices, with only a small remnant of sex industry venues. London's gay community is centred on Old Compton Street in Soho.\nSoho's reputation as a major entertainment district of London stems from theatres such as the Windmill Theatre on Great Windmill Street and the Raymond Revuebar owned by entrepreneur Paul Raymond, and music clubs such as the 2i's Coffee Bar and the Marquee Club. Trident Studios was based in Soho, and the nearby Denmark Street has hosted numerous music publishing houses and instrument shops from the 20th century onwards.

It lies within the London Borough of Tower Hamlets, which is separated from the eastern edge of the square mile of the City of London by the open space known as Tower Hill. It was founded towards the end of 1066 as part of the Norman Conquest. The White Tower, which gives the entire castle its name, was built by William the Conqueror in 1078 and was a resented symbol of oppression, inflicted upon London by the new ruling elite. The castle was also used as a prison from 1100 (Ranulf Flambard) until 1952 (Kray twins), although that was not its primary purpose. A grand palace early in its history, it served as a royal residence. As a whole, the Tower is a complex of several buildings set within two concentric rings of defensive walls and a moat. There were several phases of expansion, mainly under kings Richard I, Henry III, and Edward I in the 12th and 13th centuries. The general layout established by the late 13th century remains despite later activity on the site.\nThe Tower of London has played a prominent role in English history. It was besieged several times, and controlling it has been important to controlling the country. The Tower has served variously as an armoury, a treasury, a menagerie, the home of the Royal Mint, a public record office, and the home of the Crown Jewels of England. From the early 14th century until the reign of Charles II in the 17th century, a procession would be led from the Tower to Westminster Abbey on the coronation of a monarch. In the absence of the monarch, the Constable of the Tower is in charge of the castle. This was a powerful and trusted position in the medieval period. In the late 15th century, the Princes in the Tower were housed at the castle when they mysteriously disappeared, presumed murdered. Under the Tudors, the Tower became used less as a royal residence, and despite attempts to refortify and repair the castle, its defences lagged behind developments to deal with artillery.\nThe zenith of the castle's use as a prison was the 16th and 17th centuries, when many figures who had fallen into disgrace, such as Elizabeth I before she became queen, Sir Walter Raleigh, and Elizabeth Throckmorton, were held within its walls. This use has led to the phrase \"sent to the Tower\". Despite its enduring reputation as a place of torture and death, popularised by 16th-century religious propagandists and 19th-century writers, only seven people were executed within the Tower before the World Wars of the 20th century. Executions were more commonly held on the notorious Tower Hill to the north of the castle, with 112 occurring there over a 400-year period. In the latter half of the 19th century, institutions such as the Royal Mint moved out of the castle to other locations, leaving many buildings empty. Anthony Salvin and John Taylor took the opportunity to restore the Tower to what was felt to be its medieval appearance, clearing out many of the vacant post-medieval structures.\nIn the First and Second World Wars, the Tower was again used as a prison and witnessed the executions of 12 men for espionage. After the Second World War, damage caused during the Blitz was repaired, and the castle reopened to the public. Today, the Tower of London is one of the country's most popular tourist attractions. Under the ceremonial charge of the Constable of the Tower, and operated by the Resident Governor of the Tower of London and Keeper of the Jewel House, the property is cared for by the charity Historic Royal Palaces and is protected as a World Heritage Site.", "images": ["https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/9/98/Tower_of_London_EN.png", "https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/f/f0/Tower_of_London_White_Tower.jpg", "https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/4/42/Tower_of_London_model_close_up.jpg", "https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/1/1e/Whitetowerlondon.jpg", "https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/0/04/Panoramic_view_from_Tower_of_London_cropped.jpg", "https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/f/f6/Tower_of_London%2C_south%2C_Buck_brothers.jpg", "https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/4/43/Tower_of_London_main_entrance%2C_2009.jpg", "https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/0/06/Tower_of_London_%28Foto_Hilarmont%29.jpg", "https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/e/eb/Elephant_sculpture_by_Kendra_Haste%2C_Tower_of_London.jpg", "https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/b/b2/St_John%27s_Chapel%2C_Tower_of_London.jpg", "https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/b/b2/St_John%27s_Chapel%2C_Tower_of_London.jpg", "https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/1/18/Panorama_of_the_outer_curtain_wall_of_the_Tower_of_London%2C_2006.jpg", "https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/8/8a/Tower_of_London_%288145477096%29.jpg", "https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/1/1e/London_Tower_%28CherryX%29.jpg", "https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/6/64/Saint_Edward%27s_Crown.jpg", "https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/4/46/Tower_Hill%2C_2006.jpg", "https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/e/ec/Tower_of_London_from_the_Shard_%288515883950%29.jpg", "https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/a/a6/Stonehenge-Green.jpg", "https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/3/30/Jubilee_and_Munin%2C_Ravens%2C_Tower_of_London_2016-04-30.jpg", "https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/f/ff/1600_Aldgate.jpg", "https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/f/f9/Temple_Bar_ILN_1870.jpg", "https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/9/98/Skull_of_a_Barbary_Lion_%2825297910567%29.jpg", "https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/c/c0/Princes.jpg"], "near": ["White%20Tower%20%28Tower%20of%20London%29", "Jewel%20House", "Heralds%27%20Museum", "Tower%20of%20London", "London%20uprising", "Liberties%20of%20the%20Tower%20of%20London", "Tower%20Green", "St%20John%27s%20Chapel%2C%20London", "Church%20of%20St%20Peter%20ad%20Vincula", "John%20Dudley%2C%201st%20Duke%20of%20Northumberland"], "lat": 51.5081124, "lon": -0.0759493, "maps": "https://maps.google.com/?q=51.5081124,-0.0759493", "citymapper": "https://citymapper.com/directions?endcoord=51.5081124%2C-0.0759493&endname=Tower%20Of%20London"}));

It constituted most of London from its settlement by the Romans in the 1st century AD to the Middle Ages, but the modern area named London has since grown far beyond the City of London boundary. The City is now only a small part of the metropolis of Greater London, though it remains a notable part of central London. Administratively, the City of London is not one of the London boroughs, a status reserved for the other 32 districts (including Greater London's only other city, the City of Westminster). It is also a separate ceremonial county, being an enclave surrounded by Greater London, and is the smallest ceremonial county in the United Kingdom.\nThe City of London is widely referred to simply as the City (differentiated from the phrase \"the city of London\" by capitalising City) and known as the Square Mile, as it is 1.12 sq mi (716.80 acres; 2.90 km2) in area. Both of these terms are also often used as metonyms for the United Kingdom's trading and financial services industries, which continue a notable history of being largely based in the City. The name London is now ordinarily used for a far wider area than just the city. London most often denotes the sprawling London metropolis, or the 32 Greater London boroughs, in addition to the City of London itself. This wider usage of London is documented as well-established in 1864, and the case of Lord Henry Seymour's Will.The local authority for the City, namely the City of London Corporation, is unique in the UK and has some unusual responsibilities for a local council, such as being the police authority. It is also unusual in having responsibilities and ownerships beyond its boundaries. The corporation is headed by the Lord Mayor of the City of London (an office separate from, and much older than, the Mayor of London). The Lord Mayor, as of November 2021, is Vincent Keaveny. The City is made up of 25 wards, with administration at the historic Guildhall.  Other historic sites include St Paul's Cathedral, Royal Exchange, Mansion House, Old Bailey, and Smithfield Market.  Although not within the City, the adjacent Tower of London is part of its old defensive perimeter. The City has responsibility for five bridges in its capacity as trustee of the Bridge House Estates: Blackfriars Bridge, Millennium Bridge, Southwark Bridge, London Bridge and Tower Bridge.\nThe City is a major business and financial centre, and the Bank of England is headquartered in the city.  Throughout the 19th century, the City was the world's primary business centre, and it continues to be a major meeting point for businesses. London came second (after New York) in the Global Financial Centres Index, published in 2022. The insurance industry is located in the eastern side of the city, around Lloyd's building. Since about the 1980s, a secondary financial district has existed outside the city, at Canary Wharf, 2.5 miles (4 km) to the east.\nThe City has a resident population of 9,401 (ONS estimate, mid-2016) but over 500,000 are employed there, and some estimates put the number of workers in the City to be over 1 million. About three-quarters of the jobs in the City of London are in the financial, professional, and associated business services sectors. The legal profession forms a major component of the northern and western sides of the City, especially in the Temple and Chancery Lane areas where the Inns of Court are located, of which two\u2014Inner Temple and Middle Temple\u2014fall within the City of London boundary.\n\n", "images": ["https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/f/ff/Barbican_Centre_City_of_London.jpg",

Commemorating the Great Fire of London, it stands at the junction of Monument Street and Fish Street Hill, 202 feet (62 m) in height and 202 feet west of the spot in Pudding Lane (although this is thought to be wrong as historic blueprints show it started next door) where the Great Fire started on 2 September 1666. Constructed between 1671 and 1677, it was built on the site of St Margaret, New Fish Street, the first church to be destroyed by the Great Fire. It is Grade I-listed and is a scheduled monument. Another monument, the Golden Boy of Pye Corner, marks the point near Smithfield where the fire was stopped.\nThe Monument comprises a Doric column built of Portland stone topped with a gilded urn of fire. It was designed by Christopher Wren and Robert Hooke. Its height marks its distance from the site of the shop of Thomas Farriner (or Farynor), the king's baker, where the blaze began.\nThe viewing platform near the top of the Monument is reached by a narrow winding staircase of 345 steps. A mesh cage was added in the mid-19th century to prevent people jumping to the ground, after six people died by suicide there between 1788 and 1842.Three sides of the base carry inscriptions in Latin. The one on the south side describes actions taken by King Charles II following the fire. The inscription on the east side describes how the Monument was started and brought to perfection, and under which mayors.

The Latin words \"Sed Furor Papisticus Qui Tamdiu Patravit Nondum Restingvitur\" (but Popish frenzy, which wrought such horrors, is not yet quenched) were added to the end of the inscription on the orders of the Court of Aldermen in 1681 during the foment of the Popish Plot.

The cathedral serves as the mother church of the Diocese of London. It is on Ludgate Hill at the highest point of the City of London and is a Grade I listed building. Its dedication to Paul the Apostle dates back to the original church on this site, founded in AD 604. The present structure, dating from the late 17th century, was designed in the English Baroque style by Sir Christopher Wren. Its construction, completed in Wren's lifetime, was part of a major rebuilding programme in the city after the Great Fire of London. The earlier Gothic cathedral (Old St Paul's Cathedral), largely destroyed in the Great Fire, was a central focus for medieval and early modern London, including Paul's walk and St Paul's Churchyard, being the site of St Paul's Cross.\nThe cathedral is one of the most famous and recognisable sights of London. Its dome, surrounded by the spires of Wren's City churches, has dominated the skyline for over 300 years. At 365 ft (111 m) high, it was the tallest building in London from 1710 to 1963. The dome is still one of the highest in the world. St Paul's is the second-largest church building in area in the United Kingdom, after Liverpool Cathedral.\nServices held at St Paul's have included the funerals of Admiral Lord Nelson, the Duke of Wellington, Winston Churchill and Margaret Thatcher; jubilee celebrations for Queen Victoria; an inauguration service for the Metropolitan Hospital Sunday Fund; peace services marking the end of the First and Second World Wars; the wedding of Prince Charles and Lady Diana Spencer; the launch of the Festival of Britain; and the thanksgiving services for the Silver, Golden, Diamond, and Platinum Jubilees and the 80th and 90th birthdays of Queen Elizabeth II. St Paul's Cathedral is the central subject of much promotional material, as well as of images of the dome surrounded by the smoke and fire of the Blitz.\nThe cathedral is a working church with hourly prayer and daily services. The tourist entry fee at the door is \u00a321 for adults (Summer 2022, cheaper if booked online), but no charges are made to worshippers attending advertised services.The nearest underground station is St Paul's, which is 130 yards (120 m) away from St Paul's Cathedral.", "images": ["https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/3/37/St_Pauls.jpg", "https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/0/0a/Canaletto_-_St._Paul%27s_Cathedral_-_Google_Art_Project.jpg", "https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/a/a8/The_South_Prospect_of_St._Paul%27s_Church_London.jpg", "https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/0/0a/St_Paul%27s_old._From_Francis_Bond%2C_Early_Christian_Architecture._Last_book_1913..jpg", "https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/8/83/74_-_AS_II.13._S_elevation.jpg", "https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/7/7d/Antonio_Joli_Prospect_of_London.jpg", "https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/6/63/Dickinson_St_Paul%27s.jpg", "https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/4/41/Giovanni_Antonio_Canal_-_The_River_Thames%2C_detail.jpg", "https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/8/85/St_Pauls_Cathedral_West_Front.jpg", "https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/c/cb/St_Pauls_aerial_%28cropped%29.jpg", "https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/d/db/Julian_Assange_speaking_at_Occupy_London_protest.jpg", "https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/9/91/South_west_tower_of_St_Paul%27s_Cathedral.jpg", "https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/4/47/Tomb_of_Horatio_Nelson_on_Saint-Paul_Cathedral.jpg", "https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/d/d3/London_-_City_of_London_Police_Museum%2C_Suffragette_bombs.jpg", "https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/c/c0/Canaletto_london.jpg", "https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/e/eb/Ernest_Dade_-_St_Paul%27s_from_the_River.jpg", "https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/5/5b/St_Pauls_Cathedral_from_West_-_Feb_2007.jpg", "https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/b/b3/St_Paul%27s_Cathedral_Interior_Dome_2_crop%2C_London%2C_UK_-_Diliff.jpg", "https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/4/4f/St_Paul%27s_Cathedral_South_Organ%2C_London%2C_UK_-_Diliff.jpg", "https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/6/60/St_Paul%27s_Cathedral_Choir_looking_east%2C_London%2C_UK_-_Diliff.jpg", "https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/b/b5/St_Paul%27s_Cathedral_High_Altar%2C_London%2C_UK_-_Diliff.jpg", "https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/f/f0/St_Paul%27s_Cathedral_Nave%2C_London%2C_UK_-_Diliff.jpg", "https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/2/2f/St_Paul%27s_Cathedral%2C_London%2C_England_-_Jan_2010_edit.jpg", "https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/4/43/St_Paul%27s_Cathedral_Dome_from_One_New_Change_-_Square_Crop.jpg", "https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/f/fd/St_Paul%27s_cross%2C_London%2C_England%2C_GB%2C_IMG_5127_edit.jpg", "https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/a/a2/St_Paul%27s_Cathedral_Choir_looking_west%2C_London%2C_UK_-_Diliff.jpg", "https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/7/70/St_Paul%27s_Cathedral_Interior_Dome_3%2C_London%2C_UK_-_Diliff.jpg", "https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/f/f7/St_Paul%27s_by_Thomas_Hosmer_Shepherd_%28early_19th_century%29.jpg", "https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/7/7e/Frederick_Edward_Joseph_Goff_St_Paul%27s_from_Bankside.jpg", "https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/a/ac/Greek_and_Latin_cross_-_Temple_of_Saint_Sava_and_St_Paul%27s_Cathedral_%28St_Paul%27s%29.jpg", "https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/5/50/Operation_Banner_Service_Held_at_St_Pauls_Cathedral_in_2008_MOD_45151837.jpg", "https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/7/7f/St_Paul%27s_Cathedral%2C_London%2C_South_elevation_of_the_Great_Model_%E2%80%93_Royal_Academy_Collection.jpg", "https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/8/82/John_O%27Connor_-_Ludgate%2C_Evening_-_1887.jpg", "https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/7/7d/Edward_Angelo_Goodall04.jpg"], "near": ["Diocese%20of%20London", "Old%20St%20Paul%27s%20Cathedral", "Minor%20Canons%20of%20St%20Paul%27s", "Death%20and%20funeral%20of%20Margaret%20Thatcher", "Paul%27s%20walk", "St%20Paul%27s%20Cathedral", "Statue%20of%20John%20Wesley%2C%20St%20Paul%27s%20Churchyard", "St%20Paul%27s%20Cross", "Statue%20of%20Thomas%20Becket%2C%20London", "John%20Donne%20Memorial"], "lat": 51.5138453, "lon": -0.0983506, "maps": "https://maps.google.com/?q=51.5138453,-0.0983506", "citymapper": "https://citymapper.com/directions?endcoord=51.5138453%2C-0.0983506&endname=St.%20Paul%27s%20Cathedral"}));

Construction was completed in spring 2014, and the three-floor \"sky garden\" was opened in January 2015. The 38-storey building is 160 m (525 ft) tall. Since July 2017, the building has been owned by Lee Kum Kee Groups.\nDesigned by architect Rafael Vi\u00f1oly and costing over \u00a3200 million, 20 Fenchurch Street features a highly distinctive top-heavy form which appears to burst upward and outward.

It was subsequently approved in 2006 with the revised height. Even after the height reduction there were continued concerns from heritage groups about its impact on the surrounding area. The Secretary of State for Communities and Local Government, Ruth Kelly, called in the project for another public inquiry. The project was consequently the subject of a public inquiry; in 2007 this ruled in the developers' favour and the building was granted full planning permission. In 2015 it was awarded the Carbuncle Cup for the worst new building in the UK in the previous 12 months.In 2013 Paul Finch of the Design Council CABE said he regretted supporting the project during the public inquiry, saying that the developers \"made a mess of it\" and were architects of their own misfortune.", "images": ["https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/c/ca/The_Sky_Garden.jpg", "https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/d/d8/The_Walkie_Talkie_Sky_Garden.jpg", "https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/f/fd/20_Fenchurch_Street_retouched.jpg", "https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/5/5b/London_MMB_Z1_20_Fenchurch_Street.jpg", "https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/7/70/London_MMB_%C2%ABX4_City.jpg", "https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/e/e8/20_Fenchurch_street%2C_January_2014.jpg", "https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/5/5d/20_Fenchurch_Street_under_construction_%282013%29_-_panoramio.jpg", "https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/2/2c/Walkie-Talkie_-_Sept_2015.jpg", "https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/9/95/20-fenchurch-march31.jpg"], "near": ["20%20Fenchurch%20Street", "Kleinwort%20Hambros", "Philpot%20Lane", "St%20Margaret%20Pattens", "Lime%20Street%2C%20London", "30%20Fenchurch%20Street", "St%20Dionis%20Backchurch", "The%20Ship%2C%20Lime%20Street", "Bridge%20%28ward%29", "Plantation%20Place%20South"], "lat": 51.5112422, "lon": -0.0835493, "maps": "https://maps.google.com/?q=51.5112422,-0.0835493", "citymapper": "https://citymapper.com/directions?endcoord=51.5112422%2C-0.0835493&endname=Sky%20Garden"}));

It forms a narrow strip of riverside land within the London Borough of Lambeth (where it adjoins Albert Embankment)  and the London Borough of Southwark, (where it adjoins Bankside). As such, the South Bank may be regarded as somewhat akin to the riverside part of an area known previously as Lambeth Marsh and North Lambeth.\nWhile the South Bank is not formally defined, it is generally understood to bounded by Westminster Bridge and Blackfriars Bridge, and to be centred approximately half a mile (800 metres)  south-east of Charing Cross. The name South Bank was first widely used in 1951 during the Festival of Britain. The area's long list of attractions includes the County Hall complex, the Sea Life London Aquarium, the London Dungeon, Jubilee Gardens and the London Eye, the Southbank Centre, Royal Festival Hall, National Theatre, and BFI Southbank. In addition to their official and business functions, both the County Hall and the Shell Centre have major residential components.\nDue to it often being waterlogged in winter, the area was slower to develop than the \"North Bank\" of the Thames . Throughout its history, it has twice functioned as an entertainment district, interspersed by around a hundred years of wharfs, domestic industry and manufacturing being its dominant use. Restoration began in 1917 with the construction of County Hall at Lambeth replacing the Lion Brewery. Its Coade stone symbol was retained and placed on a pedestal at Westminster Bridge and is known as the South Bank Lion.

It is situated 5.5 miles (8.9 km) east-southeast of Charing Cross.\nGreenwich is notable for its maritime history and for giving its name to the Greenwich Meridian (0\u00b0 longitude) and Greenwich Mean Time. The town became the site of a royal palace, the Palace of Placentia from the 15th century, and was the birthplace of many Tudors, including Henry VIII and Elizabeth I. The palace fell into disrepair during the English Civil War and was demolished to be replaced by the Royal Naval Hospital for Sailors, designed by Sir Christopher Wren and his assistant Nicholas Hawksmoor. These buildings became the Royal Naval College in 1873, and they remained a military education establishment until 1998 when they passed into the hands of the Greenwich Foundation. The historic rooms within these buildings remain open to the public; other buildings are used by University of Greenwich and Trinity Laban Conservatoire of Music and Dance.\nThe town became a popular resort in the 18th century and many grand houses were built there, such as Vanbrugh Castle (1717) established on Maze Hill, next to the park. From the Georgian period estates of houses were constructed above the town centre. The maritime connections of Greenwich were celebrated in the 20th century, with the siting of the Cutty Sark and Gipsy Moth IV next to the river front, and the National Maritime Museum in the former buildings of the Royal Hospital School in 1934.\nHistorically an ancient parish in the Blackheath Hundred of Kent, the town formed part of the growing conurbation of London in the 19th century. When the County of London, an administrative area designed to replace the Metropolitan Board of Works, was formed in 1889, the parish merged with those of Charlton-next-Woolwich, Deptford St Nicholas and Kidbrooke to create the Metropolitan Borough of Greenwich. When local government in London was again reformed in 1965, it merged with most of the Metropolitan Borough of Woolwich, creating what is now the Royal Borough of Greenwich, a local authority district of Greater London.", "images": ["https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/7/70/Downtown_Greenwich%2C_England_2.jpg", "https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/0/04/Riverside_entrance_to_Trinity_Hospital%2C_Greenwich_-_geograph.org.uk_-_1164174.jpg", "https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/a/a8/Adriaen_van_Stalbemt_-_A_View_of_Greenwich.jpg", "https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/3/33/Burial_mounds_in_Greenwich_Park.jpg", "https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/c/ca/Greenwich_Market_interior.jpg", "https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/6/6e/TulipStair_QueensHouse_Greenwich.jpg", "https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/e/e4/Greenwich_arms.png", "https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/6/65/HMS_Defender_at_Greenwich.jpg", "https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/7/77/Millennium_Leisure_Park%2C_East_Greenwich_-_geograph.org.uk_-_1163888.jpg", "https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/9/92/Samuel_pepys_building_greenwich.jpg", "https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/8/83/Meridian_House_%28Former_Greenwich_Town_Hall%29.jpg", "https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/3/31/Greenwich-Royal_Observatory-016.jpg", "https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/d/dd/Greenwich_Park_Vista.jpg", "https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/a/a6/Stonehenge-Green.jpg", "https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/a/a8/Royal_Naval_College_2008.jpg", "https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/9/9f/Descriptive_map_of_London_poverty%2C_1889_Wellcome_L0027751.jpg"], "near": ["Greenwich%20Millennium%20Village", "Enderby%27s%20Wharf", "Greenwich%20Peninsula%20Ecology%20Park", "Blackwall%20Point%20Power%20Station", "Greenwich%20Peninsula", "Angerstein%20Wharf", "East%20Greenwich%20Gas%20Works", "Greenwich%20District%20Hospital", "St%20Alfege%27s%20Hospital", "North%20Greenwich%20tube%20station"], "lat": 51.4933675, "lon": 0.0098214, "maps": "https://maps.google.com/?q=51.4933675,0.0098214", "citymapper": "https://citymapper.com/directions?endcoord=51.4933675%2C0.0098214&endname=Greenwich"}));

It played a major role in the history of astronomy and navigation, and because the Prime Meridian passes through it, it gave its name to Greenwich Mean Time, the precursor to today's Coordinated Universal Time (UTC). The ROG has the IAU observatory code of 000, the first in the list. ROG, the National Maritime Museum, the Queen's House and the clipper ship Cutty Sark are collectively designated Royal Museums Greenwich.The observatory was commissioned in 1675 by King Charles II, with the foundation stone being laid on 10 August. The old hilltop site of Greenwich Castle was chosen by Sir Christopher Wren, a former Savilian Professor of Astronomy; as Greenwich Park was a royal estate, no new land needed to be bought. At that time the king also created the position of Astronomer Royal, to serve as the director of the observatory and to \"apply himself with the most exact care and diligence to the rectifying of the tables of the motions of the heavens, and the places of the fixed stars, so as to find out the so much desired longitude of places for the perfecting of the art of navigation.\" He appointed John Flamsteed as the first Astronomer Royal. The building was completed in the summer of 1676. The building was often called \"Flamsteed House\", in reference to its first occupant.\nThe scientific work of the observatory was relocated elsewhere in stages in the first half of the 20th century, and the Greenwich site is now maintained almost exclusively as a museum, although the AMAT telescope became operational for astronomical research in 2018.", "images": ["https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/c/c8/Royal_Observatory_Greenwich_London.jpg", "https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/6/6b/Greenwich_observatory_laser.jpg", "https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/8/8a/Royal_observatory_greenwich.jpg", "https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/4/4f/Royal_Greenwich_Observatory_and_Greenwich_Park.jpg", "https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/a/a6/The_Greenwich_Observatory_-_geograph.org.uk_-_1350541.jpg", "https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/1/1d/Illustration_of_Greenwich_Observatory_by_Johann_Doppelmayr.jpg", "https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/c/c9/Royal_Greenwich_Observatory_Postcard_c1902.jpg", "https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/6/68/Herstmonceux_Observatory_aerial_view.jpg", "https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/0/04/London%2C_Greenwich%2C_Royal_Greenwich_Observatory_--_2016_--_4695.jpg", "https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/9/93/Imperial_Standards_of_Length%2C_Greenwich.jpg", "https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/4/4b/28-inch_telescope%2C_Royal_Observatory_and_tree%2C_Greenwich%2C_London%2C_UK%2C_2015.jpg", "https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/8/87/Royal_Greenwich_Observatory%2C_Herstmonceux_-_April_2012.jpg", "https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/6/61/Greenwich_clock_1-manipulated.jpg", "https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/3/3c/RoyalObservatoryShepherd1824_edited.jpg", "https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/4/48/The_Altazimuth_Pavilion_in_Greenwich_Park.jpg", "https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/6/6e/Airys_Transit_Circle.jpg", "https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/0/08/Royal_Observatory.jpg", "https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/1/13/Greenwich_House_-_geograph.org.uk_-_373583.jpg", "https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/1/12/%22The_Magnetic_Pavilion%22_-_Royal_Observatory_Greenwich_ca_1900_%287890151714%29.jpg", "https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/b/b7/GreenwichChronometer.jpg", "https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/d/d7/United_Kingdom_relief_location_map.jpg", "https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/8/83/Solar_system.jpg", "https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/5/5c/Earth-moon.jpg", "https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/0/00/Crab_Nebula.jpg", "https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/e/e8/Royalobs.jpg", "https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/6/65/Prime_meridian_001.jpg", "https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/5/5f/He1523a.jpg"], "near": ["Peter%20Harrison%20Planetarium", "Greenwich%20Park", "Greenwich%2028%20inch%20refractor", "Royal%20Observatory%2C%20Greenwich", "Prime%20meridian%20%28Greenwich%29", "Shepherd%20Gate%20Clock", "Statue%20of%20Yuri%20Gagarin%2C%20Greenwich", "Greenwich%20Castle", "Queen%20Elizabeth%27s%20Oak%2C%20Greenwich%20Park", "Greenwich"], "lat": 51.476853, "lon": -0.0005002, "maps": "https://maps.google.com/?q=51.476853,-0.0005002", "citymapper": "https://citymapper.com/directions?endcoord=51.476853%2C-0.0005002&endname=Royal%20Greenwich%20Observatory"}));

Built on the River Leven, Dumbarton, Scotland in 1869 for the Jock Willis Shipping Line, she was one of the last tea clippers to be built and one of the fastest, coming at the end of a long period of design development for this type of vessel, which halted as steamships took over their routes.\nAfter the big improvement in the fuel efficiency of steamships in 1866, the opening of the Suez Canal in 1869 gave them a shorter route to China, so Cutty Sark spent only a few years on the tea trade before turning to the trade in wool from Australia, where she held the record time to Britain for ten years. Continuing improvements in steam technology meant that gradually steamships also came to dominate the longer sailing route to Australia, and the ship was sold to the Portuguese company Ferreira and Co. in 1895 and renamed Ferreira. She continued as a cargo ship until purchased in 1922 by retired sea captain Wilfred Dowman, who used her as a training ship operating from Falmouth, Cornwall. After his death, Cutty Sark was transferred to the Thames Nautical Training College, Greenhithe in 1938 where she became an auxiliary cadet training ship alongside HMS Worcester. By 1954, she had ceased to be useful as a cadet ship and was transferred to permanent dry dock at Greenwich, London, for public display.\nCutty Sark is listed by National Historic Ships as part of the National Historic Fleet (the nautical equivalent of a Grade 1 Listed Building). She is one of only three remaining original composite construction (wooden hull on an iron frame) clipper ships from the nineteenth century in part or whole, the others being the City of Adelaide, which arrived in Port Adelaide, South Australia on 3 February 2014 for preservation, and the beached skeleton of Ambassador of 1869 near Punta Arenas, Chile.\nThe ship has been damaged by fire twice in recent years, first on 21 May 2007 while undergoing conservation. She was restored and was reopened to the public on 25 April 2012.

It is one of three major museums on Exhibition Road in South Kensington, the others being the Science Museum and the Victoria and Albert Museum. The Natural History Museum's main frontage, however, is on Cromwell Road.\nThe museum is home to life and earth science specimens comprising some 80 million items within five main collections: botany, entomology, mineralogy, palaeontology and zoology. The museum is a centre of research specialising in taxonomy, identification and conservation. Given the age of the institution, many of the collections have great historical as well as scientific value, such as specimens collected by Charles Darwin. The museum is particularly famous for its exhibition of dinosaur skeletons and ornate architecture\u2014sometimes dubbed a cathedral of nature\u2014both exemplified by the large Diplodocus cast that dominated the vaulted central hall before it was replaced in 2017 with the skeleton of a blue whale hanging from the ceiling. The Natural History Museum Library contains extensive books, journals, manuscripts, and artwork collections linked to the work and research of the scientific departments; access to the library is by appointment only. The museum is recognised as the pre-eminent centre of natural history and research of related fields in the world.\nAlthough commonly referred to as the Natural History Museum, it was officially known as British Museum (Natural History) until 1992, despite legal separation from the British Museum itself in 1963. Originating from collections within the British Museum, the landmark Alfred Waterhouse building was built and opened by 1881 and later incorporated the Geological Museum. The Darwin Centre is a more recent addition, partly designed as a modern facility for storing the valuable collections.\nLike other publicly funded national museums in the United Kingdom, the Natural History Museum does not charge an admission fee.\nThe museum is an exempt charity and a non-departmental public body sponsored by the Department for Digital, Culture, Media and Sport. The Princess of Wales, is a patron of the museum. There are approximately 850 staff at the museum.

Based on the popularity of the park, the surrounding district and electoral ward were named Primrose Hill.Amenities of the park include an outdoor gym known as the Hill Trim Trail, a children's playground, and toilets, all located on the south side near Primrose Hill bridge which connects to London Zoo and Regent's Park.", "images": ["https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/c/c6/Primrose_Hill%2C_London_-16Sept2010.jpg", "https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/a/ae/Primrose_Hill_COVID_crowd_bins_2.jpg", "https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/e/e2/View_from_Primrose_Hill_at_night.jpg", "https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/8/87/Aerial_view_of_Hyde_Park.jpg", "https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/8/81/Primrose_Hill_%287263648010%29.jpg"], "near": ["Camden%20motive%20power%20depot", "Camden%20Carriage%20Servicing%20Depot", "Chalcot%20Square", "Primrose%20Hill%20railway%20station", "Apple%20Music%20Festival", "Roundhouse%20%28venue%29", "Queen%27s%20Hotel%2C%20Primrose%20Hill", "Chalk%20Farm", "Chalk%20Farm%20tube%20station", "The%20Barfly"], "lat": 51.5412572, "lon": -0.1533169, "maps": "https://maps.google.com/?q=51.5412572,-0.1533169", "citymapper": "https://citymapper.com/directions?endcoord=51.5412572%2C-0.1533169&endname=Primrose%20Hill"}));

It is associated with the former fruit-and-vegetable market in the central square, now a popular shopping and tourist site, and with the Royal Opera House, itself known as \"Covent Garden\". The district is divided by the main thoroughfare of Long Acre, north of which is given over to independent shops centred on Neal's Yard and Seven Dials, while the south contains the central square with its street performers and most of the historical buildings, theatres and entertainment facilities, including the London Transport Museum and the Theatre Royal, Drury Lane.\nThe area was fields until briefly settled in the 7th century when it became the heart of the Anglo-Saxon trading town of Lundenwic, then abandoned at the end of the 9th century after which it returned to fields. By 1200 part of it had been walled off by the Abbot of Westminster Abbey for use as arable land and orchards, later referred to as \"the garden of the Abbey and Convent\", and later \"the Convent Garden\". Following the Dissolution of the Monasteries it was granted in 1552 by the young King Edward VI to John Russell, 1st Earl of Bedford (c.1485\u20131555), the trusted adviser to his father King Henry VIII. The 4th Earl commissioned Inigo Jones to build some fine houses to attract wealthy tenants. Jones designed the Italianate arcaded square along with the church of St Paul's. The design of the square was new to London and had a significant influence on modern town planning, acting as the prototype for new estates as London grew.By 1654 a small open-air fruit-and-vegetable market had developed on the south side of the fashionable square. Gradually, both the market and the surrounding area fell into disrepute, as taverns, theatres, coffee-houses and brothels opened up. By the 18th century it had become notorious for its abundance of brothels.  An Act of Parliament was drawn up to control the area, and Charles Fowler's neo-classical building was erected in 1830 to cover and help organise the market. The market grew and further buildings were added: the Floral Hall, Charter Market, and in 1904 the Jubilee Market. By the end of the 1960s traffic congestion was causing problems, and in 1974 the market relocated to the New Covent Garden Market about three miles (5 km) south-west at Nine Elms. The central building re-opened as a shopping centre in 1980 and is now a tourist location containing cafes, pubs, small shops, and a craft market called the Apple Market, along with another market held in the Jubilee Hall.\nCovent Garden falls within the London boroughs of Westminster and Camden and the parliamentary constituencies of Cities of London and Westminster and Holborn and St Pancras. The area has been served by the Piccadilly line at Covent Garden tube station since 1907; the 300 yard journey from Leicester Square tube station is the shortest in London.", "images": ["https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/a/aa/Covent_Garden_and_people.jpg", "https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/2/20/Nebot_covent_garden_market_clean.jpg", "https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/7/78/Apple_Market%2C_Covent_Garden_-_geograph.org.uk_-_1098932.jpg", "https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/5/53/Map_of_Covent_Garden.png", "https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/5/51/Royal_Opera_House-Covent_Garden-London_crop.jpg", "https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/4/48/Old-Covent-Garden-Market%2C-1825.jpg", "https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/4/42/Covent_Garden_Interior_May_2006_crop.jpg", "https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/6/69/20180721_Covent_Garden_street_entertainment.jpg", "https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/d/d6/Covent_Garden_from_the_Ralph_Agas_1572_map_of_London_-_marked.jpg", "https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/9/93/Freemasons_Arms_-_Long_Acre_-_WC2.jpg", "https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/e/e5/John_Russell%2C_Earl_of_Bedford%2C_by_Hans_Holbein_the_Younger.jpg", "https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/e/e5/Drury_Lane_Theatre_-_August_1808.jpg", "https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/7/7b/Nealsyarddairy1.jpg", "https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/b/b4/Former_Magistrates_Court%2C_Bow_Street_%28geograph_5360286%29.jpg", "https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/6/66/1690_bedford_house.jpg"], "near": ["St%20Paul%20Covent%20Garden", "St%20Paul%27s%2C%20Covent%20Garden", "Evans%20Music-and-Supper%20Rooms", "Avenue%20of%20Stars%2C%20London", "National%20Sporting%20Club", "Middle%20Earth%20%28club%29", "Floral%20Street", "Henrietta%20Street%2C%20Covent%20Garden", "The%20Dance%20Centre", "Carpenter%27s%20Coffee%20House"], "lat": 51.5116571, "lon": -0.1240436, "maps": "https://maps.google.com/?q=51.5116571,-0.1240436", "citymapper": "https://citymapper.com/directions?endcoord=51.5116571%2C-0.1240436&endname=Covent%20Garden"}));

The cathedral serves as the mother church of the Diocese of London. It is on Ludgate Hill at the highest point of the City of London and is a Grade I listed building. Its dedication to Paul the Apostle dates back to the original church on this site, founded in AD 604. The present structure, dating from the late 17th century, was designed in the English Baroque style by Sir Christopher Wren. Its construction, completed in Wren's lifetime, was part of a major rebuilding programme in the city after the Great Fire of London. The earlier Gothic cathedral (Old St Paul's Cathedral), largely destroyed in the Great Fire, was a central focus for medieval and early modern London, including Paul's walk and St Paul's Churchyard, being the site of St Paul's Cross.\nThe cathedral is one of the most famous and recognisable sights of London. Its dome, surrounded by the spires of Wren's City churches, has dominated the skyline for over 300 years. At 365 ft (111 m) high, it was the tallest building in London from 1710 to 1963. The dome is still one of the highest in the world. St Paul's is the second-largest church building in area in the United Kingdom, after Liverpool Cathedral.\nServices held at St Paul's have included the funerals of Admiral Lord Nelson, the Duke of Wellington, Winston Churchill and Margaret Thatcher; jubilee celebrations for Queen Victoria; an inauguration service for the Metropolitan Hospital Sunday Fund; peace services marking the end of the First and Second World Wars; the wedding of Prince Charles and Lady Diana Spencer; the launch of the Festival of Britain; and the thanksgiving services for the Silver, Golden, Diamond, and Platinum Jubilees and the 80th and 90th birthdays of Queen Elizabeth II. St Paul's Cathedral is the central subject of much promotional material, as well as of images of the dome surrounded by the smoke and fire of the Blitz.\nThe cathedral is a working church with hourly prayer and daily services. The tourist entry fee at the door is \u00a321 for adults (Summer 2022, cheaper if booked online), but no charges are made to worshippers attending advertised services.The nearest underground station is St Paul's, which is 130 yards (120 m) away from St Paul's Cathedral.", "images": ["https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/3/37/St_Pauls.jpg", "https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/0/0a/Canaletto_-_St._Paul%27s_Cathedral_-_Google_Art_Project.jpg", "https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/a/a8/The_South_Prospect_of_St._Paul%27s_Church_London.jpg", "https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/0/0a/St_Paul%27s_old._From_Francis_Bond%2C_Early_Christian_Architecture._Last_book_1913..jpg", "https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/8/83/74_-_AS_II.13._S_elevation.jpg", "https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/7/7d/Antonio_Joli_Prospect_of_London.jpg", "https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/6/63/Dickinson_St_Paul%27s.jpg", "https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/4/41/Giovanni_Antonio_Canal_-_The_River_Thames%2C_detail.jpg", "https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/8/85/St_Pauls_Cathedral_West_Front.jpg", "https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/c/cb/St_Pauls_aerial_%28cropped%29.jpg", "https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/d/db/Julian_Assange_speaking_at_Occupy_London_protest.jpg", "https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/9/91/South_west_tower_of_St_Paul%27s_Cathedral.jpg", "https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/4/47/Tomb_of_Horatio_Nelson_on_Saint-Paul_Cathedral.jpg", "https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/d/d3/London_-_City_of_London_Police_Museum%2C_Suffragette_bombs.jpg", "https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/c/c0/Canaletto_london.jpg", "https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/e/eb/Ernest_Dade_-_St_Paul%27s_from_the_River.jpg", "https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/5/5b/St_Pauls_Cathedral_from_West_-_Feb_2007.jpg", "https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/b/b3/St_Paul%27s_Cathedral_Interior_Dome_2_crop%2C_London%2C_UK_-_Diliff.jpg", "https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/4/4f/St_Paul%27s_Cathedral_South_Organ%2C_London%2C_UK_-_Diliff.jpg", "https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/6/60/St_Paul%27s_Cathedral_Choir_looking_east%2C_London%2C_UK_-_Diliff.jpg", "https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/b/b5/St_Paul%27s_Cathedral_High_Altar%2C_London%2C_UK_-_Diliff.jpg", "https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/f/f0/St_Paul%27s_Cathedral_Nave%2C_London%2C_UK_-_Diliff.jpg", "https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/2/2f/St_Paul%27s_Cathedral%2C_London%2C_England_-_Jan_2010_edit.jpg", "https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/4/43/St_Paul%27s_Cathedral_Dome_from_One_New_Change_-_Square_Crop.jpg", "https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/f/fd/St_Paul%27s_cross%2C_London%2C_England%2C_GB%2C_IMG_5127_edit.jpg", "https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/a/a2/St_Paul%27s_Cathedral_Choir_looking_west%2C_London%2C_UK_-_Diliff.jpg", "https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/7/70/St_Paul%27s_Cathedral_Interior_Dome_3%2C_London%2C_UK_-_Diliff.jpg", "https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/f/f7/St_Paul%27s_by_Thomas_Hosmer_Shepherd_%28early_19th_century%29.jpg", "https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/7/7e/Frederick_Edward_Joseph_Goff_St_Paul%27s_from_Bankside.jpg", "https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/a/ac/Greek_and_Latin_cross_-_Temple_of_Saint_Sava_and_St_Paul%27s_Cathedral_%28St_Paul%27s%29.jpg", "https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/5/50/Operation_Banner_Service_Held_at_St_Pauls_Cathedral_in_2008_MOD_45151837.jpg", "https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/7/7f/St_Paul%27s_Cathedral%2C_London%2C_South_elevation_of_the_Great_Model_%E2%80%93_Royal_Academy_Collection.jpg", "https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/8/82/John_O%27Connor_-_Ludgate%2C_Evening_-_1887.jpg", "https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/7/7d/Edward_Angelo_Goodall04.jpg"], "near": ["Diocese%20of%20London", "Old%20St%20Paul%27s%20Cathedral", "Minor%20Canons%20of%20St%20Paul%27s", "Death%20and%20funeral%20of%20Margaret%20Thatcher", "Paul%27s%20walk", "St%20Paul%27s%20Cathedral", "Statue%20of%20John%20Wesley%2C%20St%20Paul%27s%20Churchyard", "St%20Paul%27s%20Cross", "Statue%20of%20Thomas%20Becket%2C%20London", "John%20Donne%20Memorial"], "lat": 51.5138453, "lon": -0.0983506, "maps": "https://maps.google.com/?q=51.5138453,-0.0983506", "citymapper": "https://citymapper.com/directions?endcoord=51.5138453%2C-0.0983506&endname=St.%20Paul%27s%20Church"}));

The heath is managed by the City of London Corporation, and lies mostly within the London Borough of Camden with the adjoining Hampstead Heath Extension and Golders Hill Park in the London Borough of Barnet.", "images": ["https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/e/ee/London-panorama-hampstead.jpg", "https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/e/e1/Hampstead_Heath%2C_North-West.jpg", "https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/7/78/Model_Boating_Pond.jpg", "https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/6/63/Panorame_from_parliament_hill.jpg", "https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/6/65/01DVG_HAMPSTEAD_HEATH_EXTENSION.jpg", "https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/3/39/Hampstead_Heath_The_writer.jpg", "https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/4/4f/Hampstead_Ponds_%28171329664%29.jpg", "https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/b/b3/Kenwood_House_false_bridge_October.jpeg", "https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/7/77/Kenwood_House.jpg", "https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/8/87/Aerial_view_of_Hyde_Park.jpg"], "near": ["Hampstead%20Heath", "Parliament%20Hill%2C%20London", "South%20Hill%20Park%2C%20London", "Hampstead%20Heath%20Ponds", "2%20Willow%20Road", "The%20Magdala", "Hampstead%20Heath%20railway%20station", "Gainsborough%20Gardens", "Keats%20House", "Downshire%20Hill"], "lat": 51.5608294, "lon": -0.1629416, "maps": "https://maps.google.com/?q=51.5608294,-0.1629416", "citymapper": "https://citymapper.com/directions?endcoord=51.5608294%2C-0.1629416&endname=Hampstead%20Heath"}));

Its Gothic revival suite of buildings, and their architectural elements of national symbolic importance, is the home of the Parliament of Canada. Parliament Hill attracts approximately three million visitors each year. Law enforcement on Parliament Hill and in the parliamentary precinct is the responsibility of the Parliamentary Protective Service (PPS).\nOriginally the site of a military base in the 18th and early 19th centuries, development of the area into a governmental precinct began in 1859, after Queen Victoria chose Ottawa as the capital of the Province of Canada. Following several extensions to the parliament and departmental buildings and a fire in 1916 that destroyed the Centre Block, Parliament Hill took on its present form with the completion of the Peace Tower in 1927. Since 2002, an extensive $3 billion renovation and rehabilitation project has been underway throughout all the precinct's buildings; work is not expected to be complete until after 2028.", "images": ["https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/0/0e/Canadian_Police_Memorial.jpg", "https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/2/22/Parliament-Ottawa.jpg", "https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/a/a0/Parliamenthill.jpg", "https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/5/58/Peace_Tower_and_Centennial_Flame.jpg", "https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/6/69/Construction_of_central_parliament_building.jpg", "https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/6/6b/Ottawa_Parliament_Gardens_Famous_Five_Women_are_Persons.jpg", "https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/b/ba/Lafontaine-sm.jpg", "https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/3/3c/Lester_Pearson%2C_statue.jpg", "https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/8/84/Baldwin-Lafontaine_April_2010.jpg", "https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/0/03/Pearson-sm.jpg", "https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/c/cd/Sir_Galahad_statue.jpg", "https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/a/a4/Alexander_Mackenzie_statue%2C_Ottawa.jpg", "https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/7/7e/George_Brown_%28Canadian_politician%29.jpg", "https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/b/bc/Parliament_after_fire_NYT_Feb_1916.jpg", "https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/c/c2/Elizabeth-sm.jpg", "https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/b/b7/Robert_Borden%2C_statue.jpg", "https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/6/6e/Harper-sm.jpg", "https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/d/d4/Persons-sm.jpg", "https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/9/92/Parliament_Hill_from_a_Hot_Air_Balloon%2C_Ottawa%2C_Ontario%2C_Canada%2C_Y2K_%287173715788%29.jpg", "https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/2/25/Diefenbaker-statue-Ottawa.jpg", "https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/8/8b/Borden-sm.jpg", "https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/a/aa/Cartier-sm.jpg", "https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/d/de/Macdonald-sm.jpg", "https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/9/99/S-Macdonald-sm.jpg", "https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/b/b0/The_Honourable_Sir_Wilfrid_Laurier_Photo_C_%28HS85-10-16873%29_-_medium_crop.jpg", "https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/3/36/Hill-old.jpg", "https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/2/2a/John_Diefenbaker_1961.png", "https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/0/0f/Queen_Elizabeth_statue_full_Ottawa.jpg", "https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/7/70/Victoria_Tower_bell_April_2006.jpg", "https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/4/42/Wilfrid_Laurier_statue_in_2010.jpg", "https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/9/96/George-Etienne_Cartier_statue%2C_Ottawa.jpg", "https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/c/c9/Baldwin-sm.jpg", "https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/a/a0/S-Victoria-sm.jpg", "https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/b/bd/Victoria-sm.jpg", "https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/f/f0/William_Lyon_Mackenzie_King_statue.jpg", "https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/a/ae/War_of_1812_Monument.jpg", "https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/b/be/20161003_09_Parliament_buildings_%2839694258941%29.jpg", "https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/4/47/Langevin_Block_%282013%29%28cropped%29.jpg", "https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/a/ae/Diamond_Jubilee_of_Queen_Elizabeth_II_-_Canadian_Senate_Foyer_%2814579919150%29.jpg", "https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/6/60/Feu-de-joie_at_Ottawa%2C_1868.jpg", "https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/4/4e/Mackenzie-sm.jpg", "https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/9/9f/Brown-sm.jpg", "https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/2/26/William_Lyon_Mackenzie_King_-_William_Lyon_Mackenzie_King_%2839295031694%29.jpg", "https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/6/62/McGee-sm.jpg"], "near": ["South%20Hill%20Park%2C%20London", "The%20Magdala", "Hampstead%20Heath%20railway%20station", "Parliament%20Hill%2C%20London", "Hampstead%20Heath", "Keats%20House", "2%20Willow%20Road", "Royal%20Free%20Hospital", "St%20John%27s%20Downshire%20Hill", "Downshire%20Hill"], "lat": 51.5570799, "lon": -0.1628282, "maps": "https://maps.google.com/?q=51.5570799,-0.1628282", "citymapper": "https://citymapper.com/directions?endcoord=51.5570799%2C-0.1628282&endname=Parliment%20Hill"}));

Its permanent collection of eight million works is among the largest and most comprehensive in existence.  It documents the story of human culture from its beginnings to the present.  The British Museum was the first public national museum in the world.The museum was established in 1753, largely based on the collections of the Anglo-Irish physician and scientist Sir Hans Sloane. It first opened to the public in 1759, in Montagu House, on the site of the current building. The museum's expansion over the following 250 years was largely a result of British colonisation and has resulted in the creation of several branch institutions, or independent spin-offs, the first being the Natural History Museum in 1881.\nIn 1973, the British Library Act 1972 detached the library department from the British Museum, but it continued to host the now separated British Library in the same Reading Room and building as the museum until 1997. The museum is a non-departmental public body sponsored by the Department for Digital, Culture, Media and Sport, and as with all national museums in the UK it charges no admission fee, except for loan exhibitions.Its ownership of a small percentage of its most famous objects originating in other countries is disputed and remains the subject of international controversy through repatriation claims, most notably in the case of the Elgin Marbles of Greece, and the Rosetta Stone of Egypt.", "images": ["https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/3/35/British_Museum_Coleraine_Hoard.jpg",

She is now permanently moored as a museum ship on the River Thames in London and is operated by the Imperial War Museum.\nConstruction of Belfast, the first ship in the Royal Navy to be named after the capital city of Northern Ireland and one of ten Town-class cruisers, began in December 1936. She was launched on St Patrick's Day 1938. Commissioned in early August 1939 shortly before the outbreak of the Second World War, Belfast was initially part of the British naval blockade against Germany. In November 1939, Belfast struck a German mine and, in spite of fears that she would be scrapped, spent more than two years undergoing extensive repairs. Belfast returned to action in November 1942 with improved firepower, radar equipment, and armour. Belfast saw action escorting Arctic convoys to the Soviet Union during 1943 and in December 1943 played an important role in the Battle of North Cape, assisting in the destruction of the German warship Scharnhorst. In June 1944, Belfast took part in Operation Overlord supporting the Normandy landings. In June 1945, she was redeployed to the Far East to join the British Pacific Fleet, arriving shortly before the end of the Second World War. Belfast saw further combat action in 1950\u201352 during the Korean War and underwent an extensive modernisation between 1956 and 1959. A number of further overseas commissions followed before she entered reserve in 1963.\nIn 1967, efforts were initiated to avert Belfast's expected scrapping and to preserve her as a museum ship. A joint committee of the Imperial War Museum, the National Maritime Museum, and the Ministry of Defence was established and then reported in June 1968 that preservation was practical. In 1971, however, the government decided against preservation, prompting the formation of the private HMS Belfast Trust to campaign for her preservation. The efforts of the Trust were successful, and the government transferred the ship to the Trust in July 1971. Brought to London, she was moored on the River Thames near Tower Bridge in the Pool of London. Opened to the public in October 1971, Belfast became a branch of the Imperial War Museum in 1978. A popular tourist attraction, Belfast received over 327,000 visitors in 2019. As a branch of a national museum and part of the National Historic Fleet, Belfast is supported by the Department for Culture, Media and Sport, admissions income, and the museum's commercial activities.", "images": ["https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/5/5a/Hms_belfast_mine_damage.jpg", "https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/1/1c/HMS_Belfast_4_db.jpg", "https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/0/02/HMS_Belfast_bombarding_Korea.jpg", "https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/0/02/HMS_Belfast_with_rainbow.jpg", "https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/6/65/HMS_Belfast_shells1.jpg", "https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/2/24/The_cruiser_HMS_Belfast_bombarding_German_positions_in_Normandy.jpg", "https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/f/f3/HMS_Belfast_-_Arctic_messdeck_1.jpg", "https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/4/42/HMS_BELFAST_at_anchor_in_Sydney_harbour%2C_August_1945._ABS694.jpg", "https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/4/47/HMS_Belfast_%28C35%29%2C_London%2C_England-25Sept2010.jpg", "https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/f/fd/HMS_Belfast_%28C35%29_and_HMS_Ocean_%28R68%29_off_Korea_1952.jpg", "https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/7/75/HMS_Somerset_%28F82%29_%26_HMS_Belfast_%28C35%29.jpg", "https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/6/66/HMS_Belfast_%28C35%29_at_Pearl_Harbor_in_1962.jpg", "https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/2/2f/London_November_2013-14a.jpg", "https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/5/5f/HMS_Belfast_%28C35%29_in_Japan_1950.jpg", "https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/e/e0/Admiral_Burnett_in_his_cabin_1943_IWM_A_12758.jpg", "https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/d/dd/The_Royal_Navy_during_the_Second_World_War_A20690.jpg"], "near": ["HMS%20Belfast", "Southwark%20Crown%20Court", "Tower%20Millennium%20Pier", "Hay%27s%20Galleria", "Sugar%20Quay", "Aston%20Webb%20House", "Tower%20Beach%2C%20London", "More%20London", "The%20Rosary%20%28house%29", "Winston%20Churchill%27s%20Britain%20At%20War%20Experience"], "lat": 51.506579, "lon": -0.081389, "maps": "https://maps.google.com/?q=51.506579,-0.081389", "citymapper": "https://citymapper.com/directions?endcoord=51.506579%2C-0.081389&endname=HMS%20Belfast"}));

The mansion was constructed during the years following 1883 for the financier and politician Sir Herbert Leon in the Victorian Gothic, Tudor, and Dutch Baroque styles, on the site of older buildings of the same name.\nDuring World War II, the estate housed the Government Code and Cypher School (GC&CS), which regularly penetrated the secret communications of the Axis Powers \u2013 most importantly the German Enigma and Lorenz ciphers. The GC&CS team of codebreakers included Alan Turing, Gordon Welchman, Hugh Alexander, Bill Tutte, and Stuart Milner-Barry. The nature of the work at Bletchley remained secret until many years after the war.\nAccording to the official historian of British Intelligence, the \"Ultra\" intelligence produced at Bletchley shortened the war by two to four years, and without it the outcome of the war would have been uncertain. The team at Bletchley Park devised automatic machinery to help with decryption, culminating in the development of Colossus, the world's first programmable digital electronic computer. Codebreaking operations at Bletchley Park came to an end in 1946 and all information about the wartime operations was classified until the mid-1970s.\nAfter the war it had various uses including as a teacher-training college and local GPO headquarters. By 1990 the huts in which the codebreakers worked were being considered for demolition and redevelopment. The Bletchley Park Trust was formed in February 1992 to save large portions of the site from development.\nMore recently, Bletchley Park has been open to the public, featuring interpretive exhibits and huts that have been rebuilt to appear as they did during their wartime operations. It receives hundreds of thousands of visitors annually. The separate National Museum of Computing, which includes a working replica Bombe machine and a rebuilt Colossus computer, is housed in Block H on the site.", "images": ["https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/4/43/Bletchley_Park_Mansion.jpg", "https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/c/c8/Location_map_United_Kingdom_Milton_Keynes.png", "https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/d/d0/Information_Flow_Bletchley_Park_Enigma_Messages.png", "https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/4/49/Bp-polish-codebreakers-plaque.jpg", "https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/c/cf/Commemorative_medal_for_those_working_at_Bletchley_Park%2C_awarded_to_Joyce_Gladys_Dickson_%28nee_Day%29.jpg", "https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/c/c4/AlanTuring-Bletchley.jpg", "https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/d/d6/Sunbeam_Talbot_2_litre_Sports_Tourer_1947.jpg", "https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/e/e0/ColossusRebuild_11.jpg", "https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/5/5c/Bombe-rebuild.jpg", "https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/d/d4/StoryOfEnigma.jpg", "https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/b/b1/RebuiltBombeFrontView.jpg", "https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/0/09/Ultra_Hut3_Graph.png", "https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/c/cd/Turing_flat.jpg", "https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/4/4b/Colossus.jpg", "https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/c/c8/Hut-1.jpg", "https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/b/b9/Hut6.jpg"], "near": ["Hut%207", "Statue%20of%20Alan%20Turing", "Bletchley%20Park", "Hut%203", "Hut%206", "Hut%208", "National%20College%20of%20Cyber%20Security", "Hut%204", "The%20National%20Museum%20of%20Computing", "St%20Mary%27s%20Church%2C%20Bletchley"], "lat": 51.9976597, "lon": -0.7406863, "maps": "https://maps.google.com/?q=51.9976597,-0.7406863", "citymapper": "https://citymapper.com/directions?endcoord=51.9976597%2C-0.7406863&endname=Bletchley%20Park%20Museum"}));

It was founded in 1852 and named after Queen Victoria and Prince Albert.\nThe V&A is located in the Royal Borough of Kensington and Chelsea, in an area known as \"Albertopolis\" because of its association with Prince Albert, the Albert Memorial and the major cultural institutions with which he was associated. These include the Natural History Museum, the Science Museum, the Royal Albert Hall and Imperial College London. The museum is a non-departmental public body sponsored by the Department for Digital, Culture, Media and Sport. As with other national British museums, entrance is free.\nThe V&A covers 12.5 acres (5.1 ha) and 145 galleries. Its collection spans 5,000 years of art, from ancient times to the present day, from the cultures of Europe, North America, Asia and North Africa.  However, the art of antiquity in most areas is not collected. The holdings of ceramics, glass, textiles, costumes, silver, ironwork, jewellery, furniture, medieval objects, sculpture, prints and printmaking, drawings and photographs are among the largest and most comprehensive in the world.\nThe museum owns the world's largest collection of post-classical sculpture, with the holdings of Italian Renaissance items being the largest outside Italy. The departments of Asia include art from South Asia, China, Japan, Korea and the Islamic world. The East Asian collections are among the best in Europe, with particular strengths in ceramics and metalwork, while the Islamic collection is amongst the largest in the Western world. Overall, it is one of the largest museums in the world.\nSince 2001, the museum has embarked on a major \u00a3150m renovation programme. New 17th- and 18th-century European galleries were opened on 9 December 2015. These restored the original Aston Webb interiors and host the European collections 1600\u20131815.  The Young V&A in east London is a branch of the museum, and a new branch in London \u2013 V&A East \u2013 is being planned.

It is the terminus for Eurostar services from Belgium, France and the Netherlands to London. It provides East Midlands Railway services to Leicester, Corby, Derby, Sheffield and Nottingham on the Midland Main Line, Southeastern high-speed trains to Kent via Ebbsfleet International and Ashford International, and Thameslink cross-London services to Bedford, Cambridge, Peterborough, Brighton, Horsham and Gatwick Airport. It stands between the British Library, the Regent's Canal and London King's Cross railway station, with which it shares a London Underground station, King's Cross St Pancras.\nThe station was constructed by the Midland Railway (MR), which had an extensive rail network across the Midlands and the North of England, but no dedicated line into London. After rail traffic problems following the 1862 International Exhibition, the MR decided to build a connection from Bedford to London with its own terminus. The station was designed by William Henry Barlow and constructed with a single-span iron roof. Following the station's opening on 1 October 1868, the MR constructed the Midland Grand Hotel on the station's fa\u00e7ade, which has been widely praised for its architecture and is now a Grade I listed building along with the rest of the station.\nIn the late 1960s, plans were made to demolish St Pancras entirely and divert services for King's Cross and Euston, leading to fierce opposition. The complex underwent an \u00a3800 million refurbishment to become the terminal for the Channel Tunnel Rail Link/High-Speed 1/HS1 as part of an urban regeneration plan across East London, which was opened by Queen Elizabeth II in November 2007.

It crosses the River Thames close to the Tower of London and is one of five London bridges owned and maintained by the Bridge House Estates, a charitable trust founded in 1282. The bridge was constructed to give better access to the East End of London, which had expanded its commercial potential in the 19th century. The bridge was opened by Edward, Prince of Wales and Alexandra, Princess of Wales in 1894.\nThe bridge is 800 feet (240 m) in length and consists of two 213-foot (65 m) bridge towers connected at the upper level by two horizontal walkways, and a central pair of bascules that can open to allow shipping. Originally hydraulically powered, the operating mechanism was converted to an electro-hydraulic system in 1972. The bridge is part of the London Inner Ring Road and thus the boundary of the London congestion charge zone, and remains an important traffic route with 40,000 crossings every day. The bridge deck is freely accessible to both vehicles and pedestrians, whereas the bridge's twin towers, high-level walkways and Victorian engine rooms form part of the Tower Bridge Exhibition.\nTower Bridge has become a recognisable London landmark. It is sometimes confused with London Bridge, about 0.5 miles (800 m) upstream, which has led to a persistent urban legend about an American purchasing the wrong bridge.", "images": ["https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/8/88/Tower_Bridge%2CLondon_Getting_Opened_2.jpg", "https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/b/b4/Tower_Bridge%2CLondon_Getting_Opened_5.jpg", "https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/f/fd/Tower_Bridge%2CLondon_Getting_Opened_6.jpg", "https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/5/59/Tower_Bridge_at_Dawn.jpg", "https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/d/d7/The_Tower_Bridge%2C_London_in_the_evening_opening.jpg", "https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/1/1e/Tower_Bridge%2C_London_Under_Construction_2.jpg", "https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/f/ff/The_Tower_Bridge%2C_London_completely_opened.jpg", "https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/9/9c/The_invitation_of_opening_of_Tower_Bridge%2C_London.jpg", "https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/c/ce/Tower_Bridge%2C_aerial_view%2C_white_lights%2C_bridge_open.jpg", "https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/d/d0/Tower_Bridge%2CLondon_Construction_photo_1.jpg", "https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/a/a8/Tower_Bridge%2C_gates_closed_-_geograph.org.uk_-_3703876.jpg", "https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/a/a7/Tower_Bridge_-_1950.jpg", "https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/a/a5/Cmglee_Tower_Bridge_tall_ship.jpg", "https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/e/ea/Opening_of_Tower_Bridge_1895.jpg", "https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/0/0d/Tower_Bridge_%28aerial_view%29.jpg", "https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/e/e3/Towerbridge_oblique_199404.jpg", "https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/6/63/Tower_Bridge_from_Shad_Thames.jpg", "https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/f/f5/Tower_Bridge_and_St_Paul%27s_Cathedral.jpg", "https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/c/c5/Tower_bridge_schm020.png", "https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/6/6f/Tower_bridge_works_1892.jpg", "https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/9/9d/Tower.bridge.9.walkwaysinterior.london.arp.jpg", "https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/4/4c/Tower.bridge.99.machinery.london.arp.jpg", "https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/8/84/SHort_Sunderland_V_DP198_201.A_Tower_Br_16.09.56_edited-3.jpg", "https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/7/7d/Chithrubar.jpg"], "near": ["Thames%20Diamond%20Jubilee%20Pageant", "Hawker%20Hunter%20Tower%20Bridge%20incident", "Tower%20Bridge%20Quay", "Anchor%20Brewhouse", "Tower%20Hotel%2C%20London", "William%20Curtis%20Ecological%20Park", "Pool%20of%20London", "Yeoman%20Warders%20Club", "Butler%27s%20Wharf", "Royal%20Foundation%20of%20St%20Katharine"], "lat": 51.5054564, "lon": -0.0753565, "maps": "https://maps.google.com/?q=51.5054564,-0.0753565", "citymapper": "https://citymapper.com/directions?endcoord=51.5054564%2C-0.0753565&endname=Tower%20Bridge"}));

They became fully operational on 27 August 1939, a week before Britain declared war on Germany. The War Rooms remained in operation throughout the Second World War, before being abandoned in August 1945 after the surrender of Japan.\nAfter the war, the historic value of the Cabinet War Rooms was recognised. Their preservation became the responsibility of the Ministry of Works and later the Department for the Environment, during which time very limited numbers of the public were able to visit by appointment. In the early 1980s, the Imperial War Museum was asked to take over the administration of the site, and the Cabinet War Rooms were opened to the public in April 1984.

Founded in 1824, it houses a collection of over 2,300 paintings dating from the mid-13th century to 1900.The Gallery is an exempt charity, and a non-departmental public body of the Department for Digital, Culture, Media and Sport. Its collection belongs to the government on behalf of the British public, and entry to the main collection is free of charge. In 2020, due to the COVID-19 pandemic it attracted only 1,197,143 visitors, a drop of 50 per cent from 2019, but it still ranked eighth on the list of most-visited art museums in the world.Unlike comparable museums in continental Europe, the National Gallery was not formed by nationalising an existing royal or princely art collection. It came into being when the British government bought 38 paintings from the heirs of John Julius Angerstein in 1824. After that initial purchase, the Gallery was shaped mainly by its early directors, especially Charles Lock Eastlake, and by private donations, which now account for two-thirds of the collection. The collection is smaller than many European national galleries, but encyclopaedic in scope; most major developments in Western painting \"from Giotto to C\u00e9zanne\" are represented with important works. It used to be claimed that this was one of the few national galleries that had all its works on permanent exhibition, but this is no longer the case.\nThe present building, the third to house the National Gallery, was designed by William Wilkins from 1832 to 1838. Only the facade onto Trafalgar Square remains essentially unchanged from this time, as the building has been expanded piecemeal throughout its history. Wilkins's building was often criticised for the perceived weaknesses of its design and for its lack of space; the latter problem led to the establishment of the Tate Gallery for British art in 1897. The Sainsbury Wing, a 1991 extension to the west by Robert Venturi and Denise Scott Brown, is a significant example of Postmodernist architecture in Britain.\nThe current Director of the National Gallery is Gabriele Finaldi.", "images": ["https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/1/1d/Staircase_hall_of_the_National_Gallery%2C_London.jpg", "https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/9/9b/Titian_-_Diana_and_Actaeon_-_Google_Art_Project.jpg", "https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/3/3d/Jan_Vermeer_van_Delft_-_Lady_Standing_at_a_Virginal_-_National_Gallery%2C_London.jpg", "https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/d/d2/National_Gallery1836.jpg", "https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/d/d4/National_Gallery_at_100_Pall_Mall.jpg", "https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/c/c7/National_Gallery_London_2013_March.jpg", "https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/3/30/The_Fighting_Temeraire%2C_JMW_Turner%2C_National_Gallery.jpg", "https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/8/88/Hans_Holbein_the_Younger_-_The_Ambassadors_-_Google_Art_Project.jpg", "https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/1/1a/TitianDianaCallistoEdinburgh.jpg", "https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/3/33/Van_Eyck_-_Arnolfini_Portrait.jpg", "https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/f/f4/Sebastiano_del_Piombo%2C_The_Raising_of_Lazarus.jpg", "https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/f/fb/Leonardo_da_Vinci_-_Virgin_of_the_Rocks_%28National_Gallery_London%29.png", "https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/7/73/National_Gallery_London_Sainsbury_Wing_2006-04-17.jpg", "https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/9/92/Piero_della_Francesca_-_Battesimo_di_Cristo_%28National_Gallery%2C_London%29.jpg", "https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/5/55/George_Bellows_-_Men_of_the_Docks_-_1912_-_The_National_Gallery.jpg", "https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/5/5f/Boris_Anrep_mosaic%2C_The_National_Gallery_-_The_Awakening_of_the_Muses.jpg", "https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/a/a6/Trafalgar_Square%2C_London_2_-_Jun_2009.jpg", "https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/d/d9/John_Constable_The_Hay_Wain.jpg", "https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/b/be/Titian_Bacchus_and_Ariadne.jpg", "https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/e/eb/Baigneurs_a_Asnieres.jpg", "https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/4/46/Vincent_Willem_van_Gogh_127.jpg", "https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/4/49/The_Evacuation_of_Paintings_From_London_during_the_Second_World_War_HU36302.jpg", "https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/7/7c/RokebyVenus.jpg"], "near": ["National%20Gallery", "St%20George%27s%20Barracks%2C%20London", "National%20Portrait%20Gallery%2C%20London", "La%20Mitrailleuse", "The%20Mud%20Soldier", "Statue%20of%20James%20II%2C%20Trafalgar%20Square", "Equestrian%20statue%20of%20George%20IV%2C%20Trafalgar%20Square", "Statue%20of%20Henry%20Irving%2C%20London", "Fourth%20plinth%2C%20Trafalgar%20Square", "Trafalgar%20Square%20Christmas%20tree"], "lat": 51.508929, "lon": -0.128299, "maps": "https://maps.google.com/?q=51.508929,-0.128299", "citymapper": "https://citymapper.com/directions?endcoord=51.508929%2C-0.128299&endname=National%20Gallery"}));

It is in the London station group, one of the busiest stations in the United Kingdom and the southern terminus of the East Coast Main Line to North East England and Scotland. Adjacent to King's Cross station is St Pancras International, the London terminus for Eurostar services to continental Europe. Beneath both main line stations is King's Cross St Pancras tube station on the London Underground; combined they form one of the country's largest and busiest transport hubs.\nThe station was opened in Kings Cross in 1852 by the Great Northern Railway on the northern edge of Central London to accommodate the East Coast Main Line. It quickly grew to cater for suburban lines and was expanded several times in the 19th century. It came under the ownership of the London and North Eastern Railway as part of the Big Four grouping in 1923, who introduced famous services such as the Flying Scotsman and locomotives such as Mallard. The station complex was redeveloped in the 1970s, simplifying the layout and providing electric suburban services, and it became a major terminus for the high-speed InterCity 125. As of 2018, long-distance trains from King's Cross are run by London North Eastern Railway  to Edinburgh Waverley, Leeds and Newcastle; other long-distance operators include Hull Trains and Grand Central. In addition, Great Northern runs suburban commuter trains in and around north London.\nIn the late 20th century, the area around the station became known for its seedy and downmarket character, and was used as a backdrop for several films as a result. A major redevelopment was undertaken in the 21st century, including restoration of the original roof, and the station became well known for its association with the Harry Potter books and films, particularly the fictional Platform 9\u00be. Following extensive track remodelling in 2021, platform 10 was taken out of use, with platform 11 becoming the new 10.", "images": ["https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/1/10/Cmglee_London_Kings_Cross_Platform_9_3_4.jpg", "https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/c/cc/Kings_Cross_at_the_junction_of_Euston_Rd_and_Pancras_Rd_-_geograph.org.uk_-_1503858.jpg", "https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/6/6f/DISTRICT%281888%29_p138_-_King%27s_Cross_Station_%28plan%29.jpg", "https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/e/eb/Deltic_at_Platform_5_-_King%27s_Cross%2C_geograph-3379622-by-The-Carlisle-Kid.jpg", "https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/b/be/Morning_rush_from_King%27s_Cross_%28CJ_Allen%2C_Steel_Highway%2C_1928%29.jpg", "https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/8/82/Underground_sign_at_Westminster.jpg", "https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/2/23/Class_105_with_Kings_Cross_Granary_in_the_background.jpg", "https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/a/a9/King%27s_Cross_Western_Concourse_-_central_position_-_2012-05-02.75.jpg", "https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/b/bd/King%27s_Cross_St._Pancras_aerial_view%2C_image_6.jpg", "https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/c/ca/EdinburghTramsGeneric.png", "https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/9/9c/Kings_Cross_ILN_1852.jpg", "https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/f/f1/King%E2%80%99s_Cross.jpg"], "near": ["Statue%20of%20Sir%20Nigel%20Gresley", "German%20Gymnasium%2C%20London", "RAF%20St%20Pancras", "London%20King%27s%20Cross%20railway%20station", "King%27s%20Cross%20fire", "King%27s%20Cross%2C%20London", "King%27s%20Cross%20St%20Pancras%20tube%20station", "Pancras%20Square%20Library", "The%20Meeting%20Place%20%28sculpture%29", "Statue%20of%20John%20Betjeman"], "lat": 51.5322396, "lon": -0.1240271, "maps": "https://maps.google.com/?q=51.5322396,-0.1240271", "citymapper": "https://citymapper.com/directions?endcoord=51.5322396%2C-0.1240271&endname=Platform%209%C2%BE%20at%20King%27s%20Cross%20Station"}));

It is named after the engineer Gustave Eiffel, whose company designed and built the tower.\nLocally nicknamed \"La dame de fer\" (French for \"Iron Lady\"), it was constructed from 1887 to 1889 as the centerpiece of the 1889 World's Fair. Although initially criticised by some of France's leading artists and intellectuals for its design, it has since become a global cultural icon of France and one of the most recognisable structures in the world. The Eiffel Tower is the most visited monument with an entrance fee in the world; 6.91 million people ascended it in 2015. It was designated a monument historique in 1964, and was named part of a UNESCO World Heritage Site (\"Paris, Banks of the Seine\") in 1991.The tower is 330 metres (1,083 ft) tall, about the same height as an 81-storey building, and the tallest structure in Paris. Its base is square, measuring 125 metres (410 ft) on each side. During its construction, the Eiffel Tower surpassed the Washington Monument to become the tallest human-made structure in the world, a title it held for 41 years until the Chrysler Building in New York City was finished in 1930. It was the first structure in the world to surpass both the 200-metre and 300-metre mark in height. Due to the addition of a broadcasting aerial at the top of the tower in 1957, it is now taller than the Chrysler Building by 5.2 metres (17 ft). Excluding transmitters, the Eiffel Tower is the second tallest free-standing structure in France after the Millau Viaduct.\nThe tower has three levels for visitors, with restaurants on the first and second levels. The top level's upper platform is 276 m (906 ft) above the ground \u2013 the highest observation deck accessible to the public in the European Union. Tickets can be purchased to ascend by stairs or lift to the first and second levels. The climb from ground level to the first level is over 300 steps, as is the climb from the first level to the second, making the entire ascent a 600 step climb.

The cathedral, dedicated to the Virgin Mary, is considered one of the finest examples of French Gothic architecture. Several of its attributes set it apart from the earlier Romanesque style, particularly its pioneering use of the rib vault and flying buttress, its enormous and colourful rose windows, and the naturalism and abundance of its sculptural decoration. Notre Dame also stands out for its musical components, notably its three pipe organs (one of which is historic) and its immense church bells.Construction of the cathedral began in 1163 under Bishop Maurice de Sully and was largely completed by 1260, though it was modified frequently in the centuries that followed. In the 1790s, during the French Revolution, Notre-Dame suffered extensive desecration; much of its religious imagery was damaged or destroyed. In the 19th century, the coronation of Napoleon I and the funerals of many of the French Republic's presidents took place at the cathedral. \nThe 1831 publication of Victor Hugo's novel Notre-Dame de Paris (known in English as The Hunchback of Notre-Dame) inspired popular interest in the cathedral, which led to a major restoration project between 1844 and 1864, supervised by Eug\u00e8ne Viollet-le-Duc. On August 26, 1944, the Liberation of Paris from German occupation was celebrated in Notre-Dame with the singing of the Magnificat. Beginning in 1963, the cathedral's fa\u00e7ade was cleaned of centuries of soot and grime. Another cleaning and restoration project was carried out between 1991 and 2000.The cathedral is one of the most widely recognized symbols of the city of Paris and the French nation. In 1805, it was awarded the honorary status of a minor basilica. As the cathedral of the archdiocese of Paris, Notre-Dame contains the cathedra of the archbishop of Paris (Laurent Ulrich). \nIn the early 21st century, approximately 12 million people visited Notre-Dame annually, making it the most visited monument in Paris. The cathedral has long been renowned for its Lent sermons, a tradition founded in the 1830s by the Dominican Jean-Baptiste Henri Lacordaire. In recent years, these sermons have increasingly often been given by leading public figures or government-employed academics.\nOver time, the cathedral has gradually been stripped of many of its original decorations and artworks. However, the cathedral still contains several noteworthy examples of Gothic, Baroque, and 19th-century sculptures, a number of 17th- and early 18th-century altarpieces, and some of the most important relics in Christendom \u2013 including the Crown of Thorns, a sliver of the true cross and a nail from the true cross.\nOn 15 April 2019, while Notre-Dame was undergoing renovation and restoration, its roof caught fire and burned for about 15 hours. The cathedral sustained serious damage as a result. The fl\u00e8che (the timber spirelet over the crossing) was destroyed, as was most of the lead-covered wooden roof above the stone vaulted ceiling. This resulted in contamination of the site and the nearby environment with lead. After the fire, many of the proposals for restoration suggested modernizing the cathedral's design, but the French National Assembly rejected this approach, enacting a law on 29 July 2019 that required the restoration to preserve the cathedral's \"historic, artistic and architectural interest\". The task of stabilizing the building against possible collapse was completed in November 2020, and reconstruction began in 2021. The government of France has said it hopes the reconstruction can be completed by Spring 2024, in time for the opening of the 2024 Summer Olympics in Paris. President Emmanuel Macron confirmed on 14 April 2021 that the cathedral site will be formally returned to the church on 15 April 2024, and that the first mass since the fire will be held in the cathedral nave on that day, even if the reconstruction has not been finished by then.", "images": ["https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/4/47/Chapelle_Saint_Denis%2C_Notre_Dame.jpg",

The Sainte-Chapelle is considered among the highest achievements of the Rayonnant period of Gothic architecture. It was commissioned by King Louis IX of France to house his collection of Passion relics, including Christ's Crown of Thorns \u2013 one of the most important relics in medieval Christendom. This was later held in the nearby Notre-Dame Cathedral until the 2019 fire, which it survived.Along with the Conciergerie, Sainte-Chapelle is one of the earliest surviving buildings of the Capetian royal palace on the \u00cele de la Cit\u00e9. Although damaged during the French Revolution and restored in the 19th century, it has one of the most extensive 13th-century stained glass collections anywhere in the world.\nSainte-Chapelle is no longer a church. It was secularised after the French Revolution, which ended state religion. It is now operated by the French Centre of National Monuments, along with the nearby Conciergerie, the other remaining vestige of the original palace.\n\n", "images":

It was built for the Paris Opera from 1861 to 1875 at the behest of Emperor Napoleon III. Initially referred to as le nouvel Op\u00e9ra de Paris (the new Paris Opera), it soon became known as the Palais Garnier, \"in acknowledgment of its extraordinary opulence\" and the architect Charles Garnier's plans and designs, which are representative of the Napoleon III style. It was the primary theatre of the Paris Opera and its associated Paris Opera Ballet until 1989, when a new opera house, the Op\u00e9ra Bastille, opened at the Place de la Bastille. The company now uses the Palais Garnier mainly for ballet. The theatre has been a monument historique of France since 1923.\nThe Palais Garnier has been called \"probably the most famous opera house in the world, a symbol of Paris like Notre Dame Cathedral, the Louvre, or the Sacr\u00e9 Coeur Basilica.\" This is at least partly due to its use as the setting for Gaston Leroux's 1910 novel The Phantom of the Opera and, especially, the novel's subsequent adaptations in films and the popular 1986 musical. Another contributing factor is that among the buildings constructed in Paris during the Second Empire, besides being the most expensive, it has been described as the only one that is \"unquestionably a masterpiece of the first rank.\"\nThis opinion is far from unanimous however: the 20th-century French architect Le Corbusier once described it as \"a lying art\" and contended that the \"Garnier movement is a d\u00e9cor of the grave\".The Palais Garnier also houses the Biblioth\u00e8que-Mus\u00e9e de l'Op\u00e9ra de Paris (Paris Opera Library-Museum), which is managed by the Biblioth\u00e8que Nationale de France and is included in unaccompanied tours of the Palais Garnier.", "images": ["https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/a/a1/Greece-Palais-Garnier.jpg",

The location of the arc and the plaza is shared between three arrondissements, 16th (south and west), 17th (north), and 8th (east). The Arc de Triomphe honours those who fought and died for France in the French Revolutionary and Napoleonic Wars, with the names of all French victories and generals inscribed on its inner and outer surfaces. Beneath its vault lies the Tomb of the Unknown Soldier from World War I.\nThe central cohesive element of the Axe historique (historic axis, a sequence of monuments and grand thoroughfares on a route running from the courtyard of the Louvre to the Grande Arche de la D\u00e9fense), the Arc de Triomphe was designed by Jean Chalgrin in 1806; its iconographic programme pits heroically nude French youths against bearded Germanic warriors in chain mail. It set the tone for public monuments with triumphant patriotic messages. Inspired by the Arch of Titus in Rome, Italy, the Arc de Triomphe has an overall height of 50 metres (164 ft), width of 45 m (148 ft) and depth of 22 m (72 ft), while its large vault is 29.19 m (95.8 ft) high and 14.62 m (48.0 ft) wide. The smaller transverse vaults are 18.68 m (61.3 ft) high and 8.44 m (27.7 ft) wide. Three weeks after the Paris victory parade in 1919 (marking the end of hostilities in World War I), Charles Godefroy flew his Nieuport biplane under the arch's primary vault, with the event captured on newsreel.Paris's Arc de Triomphe was the tallest triumphal arch until the completion of the Monumento a la Revoluci\u00f3n in Mexico City in 1938, which is 67 metres (220 ft) high. The Arch of Triumph in Pyongyang, completed in 1982, is modelled on the Arc de Triomphe and is slightly taller at 60 m (197 ft). La Grande Arche in La D\u00e9fense near Paris is 110 metres high. Although it is not named an Arc de Triomphe, it has been designed on the same model and in the perspective of the Arc de Triomphe. It qualifies as the world's tallest arch.", "images": ["https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/d/d8/Paris_Arc_de_Triomphe_06.jpg", "https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/4/4b/Paris_Arc_de_Triomphe_Mort_de_Marceau_2.jpg", "https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/6/66/Paris_Arc_de_Triomphe_inscriptions_2.jpg", "https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/8/84/Paris_Arc_de_Triomphe_inscriptions_3.jpg", "https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/e/e5/Paris_Arc_de_Triomphe_inscriptions_6.jpg", "https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/b/b5/Paris_Arc_de_Triomphe_inscriptions_7.jpg", "https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/8/8f/ArcTriompheParis.jpg", "https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/c/c4/Arc_Triomphe.jpg", "https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/3/30/Paris_Arc_de_Triomphe_07B.jpg", "https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/4/4b/Arc_de_Triomphe_1811.jpg", "https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/7/79/Arc_de_Triomphe%2C_Paris_21_October_2010.jpg", "https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/b/bd/Arc_de_Triomphe%2C_Paris_3_October_2010.jpg", "https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/5/5a/De_Gaulle_speech_plaque_in_Arc_de_Triomphe.jpg", "https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/2/28/Paris_Arc_de_Triomphe_prise_d%27Alexandrie.jpg", "https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/7/78/Crowds_of_French_patriots_line_the_Champs_Elysees-edit2.jpg", "https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/0/03/Paris_Arc_de_Triomphe_Bataille_d%27Aboukir.jpg", "https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/b/b4/Paris_Arc_de_Triomphe_passage_du_pont_d%27Arcole.jpg", "https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/3/3a/Proclamation_of_Republic_plaque_in_Arc_de_Triomphe.jpg", "https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/3/38/Sylvestre_Rude_sur_Arc_de_Triomphe_1893.jpg", "https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/9/99/Paris_-_Orthophotographie_-_2018_-_Place_Charles-de-Gaulle_02.jpg", "https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/5/54/Paris_Arc_de_Triomphe_de_l%27%C3%89toile_Bogen_3.jpg", "https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/1/1c/DecorSculpteMB.jpg", "https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/5/5d/Arc_de_Triomphe%2C_Wrapped%2C_Paris_%2851549547634%29.jpg", "https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/d/dc/Antoine_%C3%89tex%2C_Der_Friede_von_1815%2C_Halbrelief%2C_Arc_de_Triomphe%2C_Paris.jpg", "https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/5/51/Paris_%2875%29%2C_arc_de_Triomphe%2C_soldat_d%27un_monument_aux_morts_%C3%A0_l%27int%C3%A9rieur_5.jpg", "https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/5/52/Paris_Arc_de_Triomphe_de_l%27%C3%89toile_Grabmal_des_Unbekannten_Soldaten_2.jpg", "https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/d/df/Fun%C3%A9railles_de_Victor_Hugo%2C_31_mai_1885.jpg", "https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/9/93/Bas-Relief_Jemmapes.jpg", "https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/e/e6/Godefroy_flight.jpg", "https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/9/90/Batailles_grav%C3%A9es_sous_grandes_arcades.jpg", "https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/7/71/Collier%27s_1921_Vol_4_Frontispiece_--_Paris.jpg", "https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/d/d0/Batailles_grav%C3%A9es_sur_atique_ADT.jpg", "https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/b/ba/Secretary_Kerry%2C_French_Foreign_Minister_Fabius%2C_Ambassador_Hartley_Pause_After_70th_Anniversary_VE_Day_Wreath-Laying_Ceremony_in_Paris_%2817421255431%29.jpg", "https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/4/40/Figure_all%C3%A9gorique_1_grande_arche.jpg", "https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/c/c2/Figure_all%C3%A9gorique_2_grande_arche.jpg", "https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/e/ee/Bas-Relief_Austerlitz.jpg", "https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/0/03/Avenue_des_Champs-%C3%89lys%C3%A9es_01.jpg", "https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/b/bc/Paris._Arc_de_Triomphe._Postcard%2C_c.1920.jpg", "https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/a/a0/Paris_1939.jpg", "https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/9/9c/Bastille_Day_Parade_170714-D-PB383-005_%2835087624434%29.jpg", "https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/1/1f/Paris_July_2011-15a.jpg", "https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/6/6e/Paris_July_2011-16a.jpg", "https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/8/87/Paris_July_2011-17a.jpg"], "near": ["L%27Arc%20de%20Triomphe%2C%20Wrapped", "Arc%20de%20Triomphe", "Charles%20de%20Gaulle%E2%80%93%C3%89toile", "Place%20Charles%20de%20Gaulle", "Rue%20de%20Tilsitt", "Rue%20de%20Presbourg", "TV6%20%28French%20TV%20channel%29", "Tunnel%20de%20l%27%C3%89toile", "H%C3%B4tel%20de%20Breteuil", "Embassy%20of%20Ireland%2C%20Paris"], "lat": 48.8737917, "lon": 2.2950275, "maps": "https://maps.google.com/?q=48.8737917,2.2950275", "citymapper": "https://citymapper.com/directions?endcoord=48.8737917%2C2.2950275&endname=Arc%20de%20Triomphe"}));

Nonetheless, the Louvre still topped the list of most-visited art museums in the world in 2021.The museum is housed in the Louvre Palace, originally built in the late 12th to 13th century under Philip II. Remnants of the Medieval Louvre fortress are visible in the basement of the museum. Due to urban expansion, the fortress eventually lost its defensive function, and in 1546 Francis I converted it into the primary residence of the French Kings. The building was extended many times to form the present Louvre Palace. In 1682, Louis XIV chose the Palace of Versailles for his household, leaving the Louvre primarily as a place to display the royal collection, including, from 1692, a collection of ancient Greek and Roman sculpture. In 1692, the building was occupied by the Acad\u00e9mie des Inscriptions et Belles-Lettres and the Acad\u00e9mie Royale de Peinture et de Sculpture, which in 1699 held the first of a series of salons. The Acad\u00e9mie remained at the Louvre for 100 years. During the French Revolution, the National Assembly decreed that the Louvre should be used as a museum to display the nation's masterpieces.\nThe museum opened on 10 August 1793 with an exhibition of 537 paintings, the majority of the works being royal and confiscated church property. Because of structural problems with the building, the museum was closed in 1796 until 1801. The collection was increased under Napoleon and the museum was renamed Mus\u00e9e Napol\u00e9on, but after Napoleon's abdication, many works seized by his armies were returned to their original owners. The collection was further increased during the reigns of Louis XVIII and Charles X, and during the Second French Empire the museum gained 20,000 pieces. Holdings have grown steadily through donations and bequests since the Third Republic. The collection is divided among eight curatorial departments: Egyptian Antiquities; Near Eastern Antiquities; Greek, Etruscan, and Roman Antiquities; Islamic Art; Sculpture; Decorative Arts; Paintings; Prints and Drawings.\nThe Mus\u00e9e du Louvre contains more than 380,000 objects and displays 35,000 works of art in eight curatorial departments with more than 60,600 square metres (652,000 sq ft) dedicated to the permanent collection. The Louvre exhibits sculptures, objets d'art, paintings, drawings, and archaeological finds.", "images": ["https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/e/e1/Plaques_Louvre.jpg",

From its dome two hundred meters above the Seine, the Basilica overlooks the entire city of Paris and its suburbs. The breathtaking panorama makes it the most popular tourist destination in the capital after the Eiffel Tower.\nThe Basilica was first proposed by Felix Fournier, the Bishop of Nantes, in 1870 after the defeat of France and the capture of Napoleon III at the Battle of Sedan in the Franco-Prussian War. He attributed the defeat of France to the moral decline of the country since the French Revolution, and proposed a new Parisian church dedicated to the Sacred Heart of Jesus. \nThe Basilica was designed by Paul Abadie, whose Neo-Byzantine-Romanesque plan was selected from among seventy-seven proposals. Construction began in 1875 and continued for forty years under five different architects. Completed in 1914, the Basilica was formally consecrated in 1919 after World War I.Sacr\u00e9-C\u0153ur Basilica has maintained a perpetual adoration of the Holy Eucharist since 1885.

It has two sites: the H\u00f4tel Biron and surrounding grounds in central Paris, as well as just outside Paris at Rodin's old home, the Villa des Brillants at Meudon, Hauts-de-Seine. The collection includes 6,600 sculptures, 8,000 drawings, 8,000 old photographs and 7,000 objets d\u2019art. The museum receives 700,000 visitors annually.\nWhile living in the Villa des Brillants, Rodin used the H\u00f4tel Biron as his workshop from 1908, and subsequently donated his entire collection of sculptures \u2013 along with paintings by Vincent van Gogh, Claude Monet and Pierre-Auguste Renoir that he had acquired \u2013 to the French State on the condition that they turn the buildings into a museum dedicated to his works. The Mus\u00e9e Rodin contains most of Rodin's significant creations, including The Thinker, The Kiss and The Gates of Hell. Many of his sculptures are displayed in the museum's extensive garden. The museum includes a room dedicated to the works of Camille Claudel and one of the two castings of The Mature Age.\nThe gardens around the museum building contain many of the famous sculptures in natural settings. Behind the museum building are a small lake and casual restaurant. Additionally, the nearby M\u00e9tro stop, Varenne, features some of Rodin's sculptures on the platform. The building is served by M\u00e9tro (Line 13), RER (Line C: Invalides) and bus (69, 82, 87, 92).", "images": ["https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/d/dd/Le_mus%C3%A9e_Rodin.jpg", "https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/4/4a/Mains_d%27amants_by_Auguste_Rodin%2C_Mus%C3%A9e_Rodin%2C_Paris_2007.jpg", "https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/f/fe/Auguste_Rodin%2C_The_three_shades_%28Les_Trois_Ombres%29%2C_for_the_top_of_The_Gates_of_Hell%2C_before_1886%2C_plaster.jpg", "https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/b/bf/Le_Penseur_in_the_Jardin_du_Mus%C3%A9e_Rodin%2C_Paris_14_June_2015.jpg", "https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/3/3f/Rodin_et_Musee_d%27Orsay_36_%2812176346423%29.jpg", "https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/0/06/Le_Cri_dAuguste_Rodin_%28mus%C3%A9e_Rodin%29_%286215583946%29.jpg", "https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/3/3b/L%27Homme_au_nez_cass%C3%A9_%281864%29_by_Rodin%2C_marble_1.jpg", "https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/5/52/2018_Balzac_%281898%29_close-up.jpg", "https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/9/91/Burgcalaisw.jpg"], "near": ["Mus%C3%A9e%20Rodin", "H%C3%B4tel%20Biron", "Arp%C3%A8ge%20%28restaurant%29", "Varenne%20%28Paris%20M%C3%A9tro%29", "H%C3%B4tel%20de%20Villeroy%20%28Paris%2C%207th%20arrondissement%29", "Mus%C3%A9e%20des%20Plans-Reliefs", "H%C3%B4tel%20du%20Ch%C3%A2telet", "Diocese%20of%20the%20French%20Armed%20Forces", "Louis%20de%20Maud%27huy", "Paris%20Street%20Circuit"], "lat": 48.8553072, "lon": 2.3158354, "maps": "https://maps.google.com/?q=48.8553072,2.3158354", "citymapper": "https://citymapper.com/directions?endcoord=48.8553072%2C2.3158354&endname=Mus%C3%A9e%20Rodin"}));

It stands in the Latin Quarter, atop the Montagne Sainte-Genevi\u00e8ve, in the centre of the Place du Panth\u00e9on, which was named after it. The edifice was built between 1758 and 1790, from designs by Jacques-Germain Soufflot, at the behest of King Louis XV of France; the king intended it as a church dedicated to Saint Genevieve, Paris' patron saint, whose relics were to be housed in the church. Neither Soufflot nor Louis XV lived to see the church completed.\nBy the time the construction was finished, the French Revolution had started; the National Constituent Assembly voted in 1791 to transform the Church of Saint Genevieve into a mausoleum for the remains of distinguished French citizens, modelled on the Pantheon in Rome which had been used in this way since the 16th century. The first panth\u00e9onis\u00e9 was Honor\u00e9 Gabriel Riqueti, comte de Mirabeau, although his remains were removed from the building a few years later. The Panth\u00e9on was twice restored to church usage in the course of the 19th century\u2014although Soufflot's remains were transferred inside it in 1829\u2014until the French Third Republic finally decreed the building's exclusive use as a mausoleum in 1881. The placement of Victor Hugo's remains in the crypt in 1885 was its first entombment in over fifty years.\nThe successive changes in the Panth\u00e9on's purpose resulted in modifications of the pedimental sculptures and the capping of the dome by a cross or a flag; some of the originally existing windows were blocked up with masonry in order to give the interior a darker and more funereal atmosphere, which compromised somewhat Soufflot's initial attempt at combining the lightness and brightness of the Gothic cathedral with classical principles. The architecture of the Panth\u00e9on is an early example of Neoclassicism, surmounted by a dome that owes some of its character to Bramante's Tempietto.\nIn 1851, L\u00e9on Foucault conducted a demonstration of diurnal motion at the Panth\u00e9on by suspending a pendulum from the ceiling, a copy of which is still visible today. As of December 2021 the remains of 81 people (75 men and six women) had been transferred to the Panth\u00e9on. More than half of all the panth\u00e9onisations were made under Napoleon's rule during the First French Empire.", "images": ["https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/6/6a/Night_Paris.jpg",

The palace is owned by the French Republic and since 1995 has been managed, under the direction of the French Ministry of Culture, by the Public Establishment of the Palace, Museum and National Estate of Versailles. 15,000,000 people visit the Palace, Park, or Gardens of Versailles every year, making it one of the most popular tourist attractions in the world.Louis XIII built a simple hunting lodge on the site of the Palace of Versailles in 1623 and replaced it with a small ch\u00e2teau in 1631\u201334. Louis XIV expanded the ch\u00e2teau into a palace in several phases from 1661 to 1715. It was a favorite residence for both kings, and in 1682, Louis XIV moved the seat of his court and government to Versailles, making the palace the de facto capital of France. This state of affairs was continued by Kings Louis XV and Louis XVI, who primarily made interior alterations to the palace, but in 1789 the royal family and capital of France returned to Paris. For the rest of the French Revolution, the Palace of Versailles was largely abandoned and emptied of its contents, and the population of the surrounding city plummeted.\nNapoleon Bonaparte, following his takeover of France, used Versailles as a summer residence from 1810 to 1814, but did not restore it. When the French Monarchy was restored, it remained in Paris and it was not until the 1830s that meaningful repairs were made to the palace. A museum of French history was installed within it, replacing the apartments of the southern wing.\nThe palace and park were designated a World Heritage Site by UNESCO in 1979 for its importance  as the center of power, art, and science in France during the 17th and 18th centuries. The French Ministry of Culture has placed the palace, its gardens, and some of its subsidiary structures on its list of culturally significant monuments.", "images":

Preparation work began shortly after a 1774 series of basement wall collapses around the Holy Innocents' Cemetery added a sense of urgency to the cemetery-eliminating measure, and from 1786, nightly processions of covered wagons transferred remains from most of Paris' cemeteries to a mine shaft opened near the Rue de la Tombe-Issoire.The ossuary remained largely forgotten until it became a novelty-place for concerts and other private events in the early 19th century; after further renovations and the construction of accesses around Place Denfert-Rochereau, it was opened to public visitation from 1874. Since 2013, the Catacombs have numbered among the fourteen City of Paris Museums managed by Paris Mus\u00e9es. Although the ossuary comprises only a small section of the underground mines of Paris, Parisians currently often refer to the entire tunnel network as the catacombs.", "images": ["https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/d/db/DJJ_1_Catacombes_de_Paris.jpg", "https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/f/fb/Paris_Catacombs_Entrance.jpg", "https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/d/d6/Catacombs-700px.jpg", "https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/c/ce/Plan_cata_paris_1857_jms.jpg", "https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/1/13/Plan_paris_gerards1908_jms.jpg", "https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/e/e2/Saints_Innocents_1550_Hoffbauer.jpg", "https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/e/ee/Grand-Jas_Derviz.jpg"], "near": ["Catacombs%20of%20Paris", "Denfert-Rochereau%20%28Paris%20M%C3%A9tro%29", "Barri%C3%A8re%20d%27Enfer", "Place%20Denfert-Rochereau", "Denfert-Rochereau%20station", "Coll%C3%A8ge%20S%C3%A9vign%C3%A9", "Mouton-Duvernet%20%28Paris%20M%C3%A9tro%29", "Saint-Jacques%20%28Paris%20M%C3%A9tro%29", "%C3%89cole%20Camondo", "Fondation%20Cartier%20pour%20l%27Art%20Contemporain"], "lat": 48.8338325, "lon": 2.3324222, "maps": "https://maps.google.com/?q=48.8338325,2.3324222", "citymapper": "https://citymapper.com/directions?endcoord=48.8338325%2C2.3324222&endname=Paris%20Catacombs%20%28Les%20Catacombes%20de%20Paris%29"}));

The station accommodates the trains that run between the capital and northern France via the Paris\u2013Lille railway, as well as to international destinations in Belgium, Germany, the Netherlands and the United Kingdom. Located in the northern part of Paris near the Gare de l'Est in the 10th arrondissement, the Gare du Nord offers connections with several urban transport lines, including Paris M\u00e9tro, RER and buses. It is the busiest railway station in Europe by total passenger numbers; in 2015, the Gare du Nord saw more than 700,000 passengers per day.The current Gare du Nord was designed by French architect Jacques Ignace Hittorff, while the original complex was constructed between 1861 and 1864 on behalf of the Chemin de Fer du Nord company. The station replaced an earlier and much smaller terminal sharing the same name, which was operational between 1846 and 1860. The majority of its passengers have been commuters travelling between the northern suburbs of Paris and outlying towns. A substantial refurbishment programme being performed during the late 2010s and early 2020s will greatly redesign the station. The plans for this include a significant expansion of the station's footprint and ability to handle passengers, expanding onsite amenities and establishing a new departure terminal in preparation for the 2024 Summer Olympics.

It stands by the western (downstream) point of the \u00cele de la Cit\u00e9, the island in the middle of the river that was, between 250 and 225 BC, the birthplace of Paris, then known as Lutetia and, during the medieval period, the heart of the city.\nThe bridge is composed of two separate spans, one of five arches joining the left bank to the \u00cele de la Cit\u00e9, another of seven joining the island to the right bank. Old engraved maps of Paris show that the newly built bridge just grazed the downstream tip of the \u00cele de la Cit\u00e9; since then, the natural sandbar building of a mid-river island, aided by stone-faced embankments called quais, has extended the island.

From the end of the 18th century until World War One, the whole Montmartre Boheme could be seen here: painters, songwriters and poets.With its many artists setting up their easels each day for the tourists, the Place du Tertre is a reminder of the time when Montmartre was the mecca of modern art. At the beginning of the 20th century, many painters including Pablo Picasso, Amedeo Modigliani, and Maurice Utrillo were living there, some at the nearby Le Bateau-Lavoir.

It takes its name from the two nearby historical windmills, Moulin Rouge and Moulin de la Galette. The interior consists of a bar area and multiple small tables.\nThe caf\u00e9 has gained considerable fame since its appearance in the 2001 film Am\u00e9lie, in which it is the workplace of the title character.

It was rebuilt by the emperor Hadrian and probably dedicated c. 126 AD. Its date of construction is uncertain, because Hadrian chose not to inscribe the new temple but rather to retain the inscription of Agrippa's older temple, which had burned down.The building is cylindrical with a portico of large granite Corinthian columns (eight in the first rank and two groups of four behind) under a pediment. A rectangular vestibule links the porch to the rotunda, which is under a coffered concrete dome, with a central opening (oculus) to the sky. Almost two thousand years after it was built, the Pantheon's dome is still the world's largest unreinforced concrete dome. The height to the oculus and the diameter of the interior circle are the same, 43 metres (142 ft).It is one of the best-preserved of all Ancient Roman buildings, in large part because it has been in continuous use throughout its history: since the 7th century, it has been a church dedicated to St. Mary and the Martyrs (Latin: Sancta Maria ad Martyres) but informally known as \"Santa Maria Rotonda\". The square in front of the Pantheon is called Piazza della Rotonda. The Pantheon is a state property, managed by Italy's Ministry of Cultural Heritage and Activities and Tourism through the Polo Museale del Lazio. In 2013, it was visited by over 6 million people.\nThe Pantheon's large circular domed cella, with a conventional temple portico front, was unique in Roman architecture.

It is the largest ancient amphitheatre ever built, and is still the largest standing amphitheatre in the world today, despite its age. Construction began under the emperor Vespasian (r. 69\u201379 AD) in 72 and was completed in 80 AD under his successor and heir, Titus (r. 79\u201381). Further modifications were made during the reign of Domitian (r. 81\u201396). The three emperors that were patrons of the work are known as the Flavian dynasty, and the amphitheatre was named the Flavian Amphitheatre (Latin: Amphitheatrum Flavium; Italian: Anfiteatro Flavio [a\u0271fite\u02c8a\u02d0tro \u02c8fla\u02d0vjo]) by later classicists and archaeologists for its association with their family name (Flavius).\nThe Colosseum is built of travertine limestone, tuff (volcanic rock), and brick-faced concrete. It could hold an estimated 50,000 to 80,000 spectators at various points in its history, having an average audience of some 65,000; it was used for gladiatorial contests and public spectacles including animal hunts, executions, re-enactments of famous battles, and dramas based on Roman mythology, and briefly mock sea battles. The building ceased to be used for entertainment in the early medieval era. It was later reused for such purposes as housing, workshops, quarters for a religious order, a fortress, a quarry, and a Christian shrine.\nAlthough substantially ruined by earthquakes and stone robbers taking spolia, the Colosseum is still an iconic symbol of Imperial Rome and was listed as one of the New 7 Wonders of the World. It is one of Rome's most popular tourist attractions and also has links to the Roman Catholic Church, as each Good Friday the Pope leads a torchlit \"Way of the Cross\" procession that starts in the area around the Colosseum.

Citizens of the ancient city referred to this space, originally a marketplace, as the Forum Magnum, or simply the Forum.\nFor centuries the Forum was the center of day-to-day life in Rome: the site of triumphal processions and elections; the venue for public speeches, criminal trials, and gladiatorial matches; and the nucleus of commercial affairs. Here statues and monuments commemorated the city's great men. The teeming heart of ancient Rome, it has been called the most celebrated meeting place in the world, and in all history. Located in the small valley between the Palatine and Capitoline Hills, the Forum today is a sprawling ruin of architectural fragments and intermittent archaeological excavations attracting 4.5 million or more sightseers yearly.Many of the oldest and most important structures of the ancient city were located on or near the Forum. The Roman Kingdom's earliest shrines and temples were located on the southeastern edge. These included the ancient former royal residence, the Regia (8th century BC), and the Temple of Vesta (7th century BC), as well as the surrounding complex of the Vestal Virgins, all of which were rebuilt after the rise of imperial Rome.\nOther archaic shrines to the northwest, such as the Umbilicus Urbis and the Vulcanal (Shrine of Vulcan), developed into the Republic's formal Comitium (assembly area). This is where the Senate\u2014as well as Republican government itself\u2014began. The Senate House, government offices, tribunals, temples, memorials and statues gradually cluttered the area.\nOver time the archaic Comitium was replaced by the larger adjacent Forum and the focus of judicial activity moved to the new Basilica Aemilia (179 BC). Some 130 years later, Julius Caesar built the Basilica Julia, along with the new Curia Julia, refocusing both the judicial offices and the Senate itself. This new Forum, in what proved to be its final form, then served as a revitalized city square where the people of Rome could gather for commercial, political, judicial and religious pursuits in ever greater numbers.\nEventually, much economic and judicial business would transfer away from the Forum Romanum to the larger and more extravagant structures (Trajan's Forum and the Basilica Ulpia) to the north. The reign of Constantine the Great saw the construction of the last major expansion of the Forum complex\u2014the Basilica of Maxentius (312 AD). This returned the political center to the Forum until the fall of the Western Roman Empire almost two centuries later.", "images": ["https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/d/d7/Colonna_di_Foca_Forum_Romanum_Rome.jpg", "https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/5/5d/Titian_-_Portrait_of_Pope_Paul_III.jpg", "https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/6/6a/Foro_Romano_Musei_Capitolini_Roma.jpg", "https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/a/a6/Arch_Septimius_Severus_Column_Phocas_Forum_Romanum_Rome.jpg", "https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/4/47/Ludwig_Theodor_Choulant_Forum_Romanum.jpg", "https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/c/c5/Roma_Plan.jpg", "https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/8/81/Roman_forum_sketch_up_model.png", "https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/1/15/Foro_romano_tempio_Saturno_09feb08_01.jpg", "https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/c/ca/Ippolito_Caffi_-_A_view_of_the_Roman_Forum_with_the_Arch_of_Constantine.jpg", "https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/8/8d/Platner-forum-republic-96_recontructed_color.jpg", "https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/0/04/JMW_Turner_-_Modern_Rome_-_Campo_Vacino.jpg", "https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/3/34/Claude_Lorrain_004.jpg", "https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/2/28/Rome-_Ruins_of_the_Forum%2C_Looking_towards_the_Capitol.jpg", "https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/d/d7/Forum_romanum_6k_%285760x2097%29.jpg", "https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/d/df/Rome_in_753_BC.png", "https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/5/5a/2012-02-17_Foro_Romano_da_Palazzo_Senatorio_3.jpg"], "near": ["Lacus%20Curtius", "Roman%20Forum", "Comitium", "Graecostasis", "Column%20of%20Phocas", "Lapis%20Niger", "Sant%27Adriano%20al%20Foro", "Arch%20of%20Septimius%20Severus", "Basilica%20Julia", "Basilica%20Fulvia"], "lat": 41.8924623, "lon": 12.485325, "maps": "https://maps.google.com/?q=41.8924623,12.485325", "citymapper": "https://citymapper.com/directions?endcoord=41.8924623%2C12.485325&endname=Roman%20Forum"}));

Additional paintings of note include Titian's Sacred and Profane Love, Raphael's Entombment of Christ and works by Peter Paul Rubens and Federico Barocci.", "images": ["https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/5/5d/Galleria_borghese_facade.jpg", "https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/9/9c/Bernini_Truth_unveiled_by_Time_Gal_Borghese.jpg", "https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/8/88/Bernini_ScipioneBorghese.jpg", "https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/3/32/Painting_of_Susanna_and_the_Elders_by_Rubens.jpg", "https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/1/16/Paolina_Borghese_%28Canova%29.jpg", "https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/7/7d/Sisto_Badalocchio_-_The_Entombment_of_Christ%2C_1610.jpg", "https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/2/2a/Michelangelo_Merisi_da_Caravaggio_-_Sick_Bacchus_-_WGA04072.jpg", "https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/b/b4/Giovanni_Bellini_-_Madonna_and_Child_-_WGA01777.jpg", "https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/8/87/Lady_with_unicorn_by_Rafael_Santi.jpg", "https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/c/c4/Gerrit_van_Honthorst_cat02.jpg", "https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/1/12/Michelangelo_Merisi_da_Caravaggio_-_Boy_with_a_Basket_of_Fruit_-_WGA04074.jpg", "https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/2/25/Michelangelo_Merisi_da_Caravaggio_-_St_John_the_Baptist_-_WGA04196.jpg", "https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/f/ff/Madonna_and_Child_with_St._Anne-Caravaggio_%28c._1605-6%29.jpg", "https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/3/3d/Gianlorenzo_Bernini_-_Self-Portrait_as_a_Young_Man_-_WGA01971.jpg", "https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/c/c6/Lorenzo_Lotto_-_Madonna_and_Child_with_St_Ignatius_of_Antioch_and_St_Onophrius_-_WGA13663.jpg", "https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/2/2d/Paolo_Veronese_-_St_John_the_Baptist_Preaching_-_WGA24813.jpg", "https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/7/7d/Domenichino_-_Diana_and_her_Nymphs_-_WGA06390.jpg", "https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/4/4d/Antonello_da_Messina_054.jpg", "https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/e/ed/Tiziano_-_Amor_Sacro_y_Amor_Profano_%28Galer%C3%ADa_Borghese%2C_Roma%2C_1514%29.jpg", "https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/2/20/Caravaggio_-_Saint_Jerome_Writing%2C_c1606.jpg", "https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/5/55/Titian_-_The_Scourging_of_Christ_-_WGA22826.jpg", "https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/1/18/Rafael_-_A_deposi%C3%A7%C3%A3o.jpg", "https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/7/70/Rubens_Deposition.jpg", "https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/4/41/RapeOfProserpina.jpg", "https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/6/65/Bernini%27s_David.jpg", "https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/c/c8/Jacopo_da_Ponte_-_The_Last_Supper_-_WGA01433.jpg", "https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/0/02/Correggio_-_Dana%C3%AB_-_WGA05341.jpg", "https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/f/f1/Titian_-_Venus_Blindfolding_Cupid_-_WGA22908.jpg", "https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/9/9b/Parmigianino_-_Portrait_of_a_Man_-_WGA17040.jpg", "https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/e/e8/Dominikus_von_Tizian.jpg", "https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/0/0c/Roma_1003_40.jpg", "https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/5/59/DossoDossi.jpg"], "near": ["Villa%20Borghese%20gardens", "Galleria%20Borghese", "The%20Goat%20Amalthea%20with%20the%20Infant%20Jupiter%20and%20a%20Faun", "David%20%28Bernini%29", "The%20Rape%20of%20Proserpina", "Aeneas%2C%20Anchises%2C%20and%20Ascanius", "Truth%20Unveiled%20by%20Time%20%28Bernini%29", "Two%20Busts%20of%20Cardinal%20Scipione%20Borghese", "Santa%20Teresa%2C%20Rome", "Horti%20Aciliorum"], "lat": 41.9142103, "lon": 12.4921442, "maps": "https://maps.google.com/?q=41.9142103,12.4921442", "citymapper": "https://citymapper.com/directions?endcoord=41.9142103%2C12.4921442&endname=Galleria%20Borghese"}));

John was the cousin of Jesus, and his calling was to prepare the way for the coming of the Messiah. He lived in the wilderness of Judea between Jerusalem and the Dead Sea, \"his raiment of camel's hair, and a leather girdle about his loins; and his meat was locusts and wild honey.\" He baptised Jesus in the Jordan, and was eventually killed by Herod Antipas when he called upon the king to reform his evil ways. John was frequently shown in Christian art, identifiable by his bowl, reed cross, camel's skin and lamb. The most popular scene prior to the Counter-Reformation was of John's baptism of Jesus, or else the infant Baptist together with the infant Jesus and Mary his mother, frequently supplemented by the Baptist's own mother St Elizabeth. John alone in the desert was less popular, but not unknown. For the young Caravaggio, John was invariably a boy or youth alone in the wilderness. This image was based on the statement in the Gospel of Luke that \"the child grew and was strengthened in spirit, and was in the deserts until the day of his manifestation to Israel.\"  These works allowed a religious treatment of the partly clothed youths he liked to paint at this period.Apart from these works showing John alone, mostly dated to his early years, Caravaggio painted three great narrative scenes of John's death: the great Execution in Malta, and two sombre Salomes with his head, one in Madrid, and one in London.", "images": ["https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/9/91/Accademia_-_Madonna_col_Bambino_tra_san_Giovanni_Battista_e_una_santa_Cat.881.jpg", "https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/d/d3/Caravaggio-Baptist-reclining.jpg", "https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/4/49/Caravaggio_sleeping_cupid.jpg", "https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/d/df/Amor_Vincet_Omnia.jpg", "https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/4/4b/Michelangelo_Merisi%2C_called_Caravaggio_-_Saint_John_the_Baptist_in_the_Wilderness_-_Google_Art_Project.jpg", "https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/a/af/Andrea-del-Sarto%2C-John-the-Baptist.jpg", "https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/4/48/Caravaggio-Baptist-Toledo.jpg", "https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/e/e0/Caravaggio_%28Michelangelo_Merisi%29_-_Saint_John_the_Baptist_-_Google_Art_Project.jpg", "https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/4/45/Michelangelo%2C_ignudo_06.jpg", "https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/1/11/Michelangelo_Merisi_da_Caravaggio_-_St_John_the_Baptist_-_WGA04154.jpg", "https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/b/b5/Michelangelo_Merisi_da_Caravaggio_-_St_John_the_Baptist_at_the_Well_-_WGA04201.jpg", "https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/8/84/Rafael_-_S%C3%A3o_Jo%C3%A3o_Batista.jpg", "https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/5/54/Caravaggio-Sacrifice-I-deta.jpg", "https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/2/26/John_the_Baptist_%28Galleria_Borghese%29-Caravaggio_%281610%29.jpg"], "near": ["Capitoline%20Museums", "Municipio%20I", "Metropolitan%20City%20of%20Rome%20Capital", "Municipio%20XII", "Municipio%20II", "Municipio%20XIX", "Municipio%20VIII", "Province%20of%20Rome", "Equestrian%20Statue%20of%20Marcus%20Aurelius", "Rome"], "lat": 41.8929428, "lon": 12.4825577, "maps": "https://maps.google.com/?q=41.8929428,12.4825577", "citymapper": "https://citymapper.com/directions?endcoord=41.8929428%2C12.4825577&endname=Musei%20Capitolini"}));

The archbasilica lies outside of Vatican City proper, which is located approximately 4 kilometres (2.5 mi) to the northwest. Nevertheless, as properties of the Holy See, the archbasilica and its adjoining edifices enjoy an extraterritorial status from Italy, pursuant to the terms of the Lateran Treaty of 1929.The church is the oldest and highest ranking of the four major papal basilicas as well as one of the Seven Pilgrim Churches of Rome, holding the unique title of \"archbasilica\". Founded in 324, it is the oldest public church in the city of Rome, and the oldest basilica of the Western world. It houses the cathedra of the Roman bishop, and has the title of ecumenical mother church of the Roman Catholic faithful. The building deteriorated during the Middle Ages and was badly damaged by two fires in the 14th century. It was rebuilt in the late 16th century during the reign of Pope Sixtus V. The new structure's interior was renovated in the late 17th century, and its fa\u00e7ade was completed in 1735 under Pope Clement XII.\nThe current rector is Cardinal Archpriest Angelo De Donatis, Vicar General for the Diocese of Rome. The President of the French Republic, currently Emmanuel Macron, is ex officio the \"First and Only Honorary Canon\" of the archbasilica, a title that the heads of state of France have possessed since King Henry IV.\nThe large Latin inscription on the fa\u00e7ade reads: Clemens XII Pont Max Anno V Christo Salvatori In Hon SS Ioan Bapt et Evang. This abbreviated inscription translates as: \"Pope Clement XII, in the fifth year [of his Pontificate, dedicated this building] to Christ the Savior, in honor of Saints John the Baptist and [John] the Evangelist\". The inscription indicates, with its full title (see below), that the archbasilica was originally dedicated to Christ the Savior and, centuries later, co-dedicated to Saint John the Baptist and Saint John the Evangelist. Christ the Savior remains its primary dedication, and its titular feast day is 6 August, the Transfiguration of Christ. As the cathedral of the pope as bishop of Rome, it ranks superior to all other churches of the Roman Catholic Church, including Saint Peter's Basilica.\n\n", "images": ["https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/0/0a/Rom%2C_Basilika_San_Giovanni_in_Laterano%2C_Decke_der_Basilika_2.jpg", "https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/6/62/San_Giovanni_in_Laterano_-_Baldacchino.jpg", "https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/b/b2/Rom%2C_San_Giovanni_in_Laterano%2C_Innenansicht.jpg", "https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/5/5c/San_Giovanni_in_Laterano_-_Rome.jpg", "https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/1/1f/Simone_a_San_Giovanni_in_Laterano.jpeg", "https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/e/e4/Rom%2C_Basilika_San_Giovanni_in_Laterano%2C_Hl._Johannes_der_T%C3%A4ufer_2.jpg", "https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/4/46/San_Giovanni_in_Laterano_-_Seitenansicht.jpg", "https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/9/9b/St_John_Lateran_ceiling.jpg", "https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/d/dc/Lateran_Obelisk_HD.jpg", "https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/1/10/Jacobus_Major_San_Giovanni_in_Laterano_2006-09-07.jpg", "https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/d/da/Jacobus_Minor_San_Giovanni_in_Laterano_2006-09-07.jpg", "https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/b/b4/St_John_Lateran_claim_as_head_church_in_the_world.jpg", "https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/b/b2/Andreas_San_Giovanni_in_Laterano_2006-09-07.jpg", "https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/5/5e/Bartholomaeus_San_Giovanni_in_Laterano_2006-09-07.jpg", "https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/8/84/Inscription_Ecclesiarum_Mater_San_Giovanni_in_Laterano_2006-09-07.jpg", "https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/8/84/Lateran_baptistery%2C_entrance.jpg", "https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/a/a2/Lazio_Roma_SGiovanni1_tango7174.jpg", "https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/0/0b/Thomas_San_Giovanni_in_Laterano_2006-09-07_n2.jpg", "https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/4/4b/Notre_Dame_de_Czestochowa.jpg", "https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/9/9d/Lazio_Roma_SGiovanni2_tango7174.jpg", "https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/8/80/Matthaeus_San_Giovanni_in_Laterano_2006-09-07.jpg", "https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/b/b5/Thaddeus_San_Giovanni_in_Laterano_2006-09-07.jpg", "https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/f/f6/Triclinium_of_Leo_III.jpg", "https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/7/77/Rome_Scala_Santa_2020_P01.jpg", "https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/1/19/Helena_tomb.jpg", "https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/f/f1/Johannes_San_Giovanni_in_Laterano_2006-09-07.jpg", "https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/8/8d/Papal_Archbasilica_of_St._John_In_Lateran_Inside_Photo.jpg", "https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/5/5d/Paulus_San_Giovanni_in_Laterano_2006-09-07.jpg", "https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/7/79/Petrus_San_Giovanni_in_Laterano_2006-09-07.jpg", "https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/d/d6/Philippus_San_Giovanni_in_Laterano_2006-09-07.jpg", "https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/2/2f/Latran_int%C3%A9rieur.jpg", "https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/5/5a/046CupolaSPietro.jpg"], "near": ["Diocese%20of%20Rome", "Archbasilica%20of%20Saint%20John%20Lateran", "Pontifical%20Lateran%20University", "Vatican%20Historical%20Museum", "Lateran%20Palace", "Lateran%20Baptistery", "Scala%20Sancta", "Sancta%20Sanctorum%20%28Lateran%2C%20Rome%29", "Porta%20Asinaria", "Santi%20Andrea%20e%20Bartolomeo%20%28Rome%29"], "lat": 41.8858811, "lon": 12.505673, "maps": "https://maps.google.com/?q=41.8858811,12.505673", "citymapper": "https://citymapper.com/directions?endcoord=41.8858811%2C12.505673&endname=Arcibasilica%20di%20San%20Giovanni%20in%20Laterano"}));

It was initially planned by Pope Nicholas V and then Pope Julius II to replace the aging Old St. Peter's Basilica, which was built in the fourth century by Roman emperor Constantine the Great. Construction of the present basilica began on 18 April 1506 and was completed on 18 November 1626.Designed principally by Donato Bramante, Michelangelo, Carlo Maderno and Gian Lorenzo Bernini, St. Peter's is the most renowned work of Renaissance architecture and the largest church in the world by interior measure. While it is neither the mother church of the Catholic Church nor the cathedral of the Diocese of Rome (these equivalent titles being held by the Archbasilica of Saint John Lateran in Rome), St. Peter's is regarded as one of the holiest Catholic shrines. It has been described as \"holding a unique position in the Christian world\" and as \"the greatest of all churches of Christendom.\"Catholic tradition holds that the basilica is the burial site of Saint Peter, chief among Jesus's apostles and also the first Bishop of Rome (Pope). Saint Peter's tomb is supposedly directly below the high altar of the basilica, also known as the Altar of the Confession. For this reason, many popes have been interred at St. Peter's since the Early Christian period.\nSt. Peter's is famous as a place of pilgrimage and for its liturgical functions. The pope presides at a number of liturgies throughout the year both within the basilica or the adjoining St. Peter's Square; these liturgies draw audiences numbering from 15,000 to over 80,000 people. St. Peter's has many historical associations, with the Early Christian Church, the Papacy, the Protestant Reformation and Catholic Counter-reformation and numerous artists, especially Michelangelo.

It was initially planned by Pope Nicholas V and then Pope Julius II to replace the aging Old St. Peter's Basilica, which was built in the fourth century by Roman emperor Constantine the Great. Construction of the present basilica began on 18 April 1506 and was completed on 18 November 1626.Designed principally by Donato Bramante, Michelangelo, Carlo Maderno and Gian Lorenzo Bernini, St. Peter's is the most renowned work of Renaissance architecture and the largest church in the world by interior measure. While it is neither the mother church of the Catholic Church nor the cathedral of the Diocese of Rome (these equivalent titles being held by the Archbasilica of Saint John Lateran in Rome), St. Peter's is regarded as one of the holiest Catholic shrines. It has been described as \"holding a unique position in the Christian world\" and as \"the greatest of all churches of Christendom.\"Catholic tradition holds that the basilica is the burial site of Saint Peter, chief among Jesus's apostles and also the first Bishop of Rome (Pope). Saint Peter's tomb is supposedly directly below the high altar of the basilica, also known as the Altar of the Confession. For this reason, many popes have been interred at St. Peter's since the Early Christian period.\nSt. Peter's is famous as a place of pilgrimage and for its liturgical functions. The pope presides at a number of liturgies throughout the year both within the basilica or the adjoining St. Peter's Square; these liturgies draw audiences numbering from 15,000 to over 80,000 people. St. Peter's has many historical associations, with the Early Christian Church, the Papacy, the Protestant Reformation and Catholic Counter-reformation and numerous artists, especially Michelangelo. As a work of architecture, it is regarded as the greatest building of its age. St. Peter's is one of the four churches in the world that hold the rank of Major papal basilica, all four of which are in Rome, and is also one of the Seven Pilgrim Churches of Rome.

Also known simply as the Vatican, the state became independent from Italy in 1929 with the Lateran Treaty, and it is a distinct territory under \"full ownership, exclusive dominion, and sovereign authority and jurisdiction\" of the Holy See, itself a sovereign entity of international law, which maintains the city state's temporal, diplomatic, and spiritual independence. With an area of 49 hectares (121 acres) and a 2019 population of about 453, it is the smallest state in the world both by area and population. As governed by the Holy See, Vatican City State is an ecclesiastical or sacerdotal-monarchical state ruled by the pope who is the bishop of Rome and head of the Catholic Church. The highest state functionaries are all Catholic clergy of various national origins. After the Avignon Papacy (1309\u20131377) the popes have mainly resided at the Apostolic Palace within what is now Vatican City, although at times residing instead in the Quirinal Palace in Rome or elsewhere.\nThe Holy See dates back to Early Christianity and is the principal episcopal see of the Catholic Church, which has approximately 1.329 billion baptised Catholics in the world as of 2018 in the Latin Church and 23 Eastern Catholic Churches. The independent state of Vatican City, on the other hand, came into existence on 11 February 1929 by the Lateran Treaty between the Holy See and Italy, which spoke of it as a new creation, not as a vestige of the much larger Papal States (756\u20131870), which had previously encompassed much of central Italy.\nVatican City contains religious and cultural sites such as St. Peter's Basilica, the Sistine Chapel, and the Vatican Museums. They feature some of the world's most famous paintings and sculptures. The unique economy of Vatican City is supported financially by donations from the faithful, by the sale of postage stamps and souvenirs, fees for admission to museums, and sales of publications.

It was originally introduced by the Catholic Church, particularly by the Jesuits, as a means to combat the Reformation and the Protestant church with a new architecture that inspired surprise and awe. It reached its peak in the High Baroque (1625\u20131675), when it was used in churches and palaces in Italy, Spain, Portugal, France, Bavaria and Austria. In the Late Baroque period (1675\u20131750), it reached as far as Russia and the Spanish and Portuguese colonies in Latin America. About 1730, an even more elaborately decorative variant called Rococo appeared and flourished in Central Europe.Baroque architects took the basic elements of Renaissance architecture, including domes and colonnades, and made them higher, grander, more decorated, and more dramatic.  The interior effects were often achieved with the use of quadratura, or trompe-l'\u0153il painting combined with sculpture; the eye is drawn upward, giving the illusion that one is looking into the heavens. Clusters of sculpted angels and painted figures crowd the ceiling.  Light was also used for dramatic effect; it streamed down from Cupolas, and was reflected from an abundance of gilding. Twisted columns were also often used, to give an illusion of upwards motion, and cartouches and other decorative elements occupied every available space. In Baroque palaces, grand stairways became a central element.The Early Baroque (1584\u20131625) was largely dominated by the work of Roman architects, notably the Church of the Ges\u00f9 by Giacomo della Porta (consecrated 1584) facade and colonnade of St. Peter's Basilica by Carlo Maderno (completed 1612) and the lavish Barberini Palace interiors by Pietro da Cortona (1633\u20131639). Church of the Ges\u00f9 by Giacomo della Porta (consecrated 1584), interior, and Santa Susanna (1603), by Carlo Maderno.  In France, the Luxembourg Palace (1615\u201345) built by Salomon de Brosse for Marie de Medici was an early example of the style.The  High Baroque (1625\u20131675) produced major works in Rome by Pietro da Cortona, including the (Church of Santi Luca e Martina) (1635\u201350); by Francesco Borromini (San Carlo alle Quattro Fontane (1634\u20131646)); and by Gian Lorenzo Bernini (The colonnade of St. Peter's Basilica) (1656\u201357).  In Venice, High Baroque works included Santa Maria della Salute by Baldassare Longhena. Examples in France included the Pavillon de l\u2019Horloge of the Louvre Palace by Jacques Lemercier (1624\u20131645), the Chapel of the Sorbonne by Jacques Lemercier (1626\u201335) and the Ch\u00e2teau de Maisons by Fran\u00e7ois Mansart (1630\u20131651).\nThe Late Baroque (1675\u20131750) saw the style spread to all parts of Europe, and to the colonies of Spain and Portugal in the New World. National styles became more varied and distinct.  The Late Baroque in France, under Louis XIV, was more ordered and classical; examples included the Hall of Mirrors of the Palace of Versailles and the dome of Les Invalides. An especially ornate variant, appeared in the early 18th century; it was first called Rocaille in France; then Rococo in Spain and Central Europe. The sculpted and painted decoration covered every space on the walls and ceiling. Its most celebrated architect was Balthasar Neumann, noted for the Basilica of the Fourteen Holy Helpers and the W\u00fcrzburg Residence (1749\u201351).", "images":
