As a Cathedral Church, it is the permanent seat of the Archbishop of Santiago and is dedicated to the Assumption of the Virgin Mary.\\nIt is located in the commune of Santiago, in front of the Plaza de Armas. The architectural ensemble of the cathedral is made up of the Archbishop\\'s Palace, the Parish del Sagrario and the cathedral itself. All these buildings are considered national monuments.\\nit was built between 1748 and 1906, designed by Joaquín Toesca and Ignacio Cremonesi. Many temples preceded the one that exists today, the current one being the fifth built on the site.\\n\\n\\n## History \\n## The earlier cathedrals =When refounding the city of Santiago de Chile on an Inca tambo, Pedro de Valdivia assigned the Inca temple to the northeast side of the Plaza Mayor or Plaza de Armas for the construction of a church, and while it was being built, religious services such as the Eucharist, they were celebrated at the door of the governor\\'s house, located where the Central Post Office is currently located. Probably, originally it must have consisted only of a chapel made of light materials, such as straw and mud; and at least since 1544, there is news that masses were no longer celebrated outdoors, so a suitable building had to be created to carry out Catholic practices.\\nBetween 1566 and 1600 the first cathedral temple was built. With much smaller dimensions than the current ones, it was richly decorated and was arranged in a north-south direction, with its façade on Calle Catedral. However, later, its main access would be facing the square, in the so-called \"Puerta del Perdón\"; especially after a controversy that occurred around the year 1600, where it was argued that the north door should be closed due to the indecency of the houses that were in front of it (because they were neighbors and not part of the cult). That door was partially or totally blinded until its destruction in 1769.\\nOn May 13, 1647, an earthquake affected the central area of the Captaincy General of Chile, destroying almost the entire city of Santiago along with the cathedral. However, the central nave of the cathedral withstood the attack, although its sagrario collapsed and its belongings could only be rescued days later. Thanks to the initiative of Bishop Gaspar de Villarroel, it was quickly retouched, although not for long. By 1657, a new telluric movement almost completely ruined its structure, and a second reconstruction had to be carried out between 1662 and 1687.\\n\\n## Bishop González\\'s project =The 1730 Valparaíso earthquake once again cracked the cathedral structure, thus determining that the repairs carried out four decades earlier had been useless. To this was added the numerous accidents that had affected the structure. That is why, in 1746, Bishop Juan González Melgarejo considered that the temple should be renovated in its entirety.\\nThe plans for this new cathedral were the work of Pedro Vogl and Juan Hagen, two members of the Society of Jesus, of Bavarian origin, who sent their project to Spain for royal approval in 1753. However, the work had already begun in 1748. After Vogl and Hagen, Matías Vásquez de Acuña and Francisco Antonio de Barros continued as directors of the works. The latter had a short time in the works, since in 1779 the Italian architect Joaquín Toesca made his appearance, to direct the construction.\\nBishop González acquired the properties next to the cathedral, at the corner of the current Catedral and Bandera streets, which belonged to the Pineda Bascuñán family; and decided to place the feet (the Altar) of the new building in Bandera and the front in the square, with a length of 100 meters, changing the direction that had originally been arranged by Valdivia in the 16th century. In order not to be forced to destroy the old temple, and to be able to continue celebrating religious services, González ordered work to begin in the new section. On July 1, 1748, the first stone of the new building was laid.\\nGonzález contributed 55,512 pesos with 4 1/2 reales for the work, and his successor Manuel de Alday with more than 160,000 pesos. The Crown, by 1788, had donated 97,994 pesos with 3 1/2 reales. For that year, 390,235 pesos with 5 and 1/8 reales had been spent on the cathedral, which had already been nearly two-thirds completed. After that they spent 48,964 pesos with 2 1/3 reales for the work, totaling 456,772 pesos with 8 and 3 reales in the cathedral.\\n\\n## The fire of 1769 =On the night of December 22, 1769, a fire broke out that destroyed the entire old cathedral, probably because the oil from the lamp that illuminated the Blessed Sacrament had spilled on some combustible object. To the clamor of the bells of the other churches, the people flocked to the scene of the incident, but it was already too late: only an image of the Virgin of Sorrows had been saved from the incident, which was located at the Puerta del Perdón. Apart from For this, according to Vásquez de Acuña, some molten silver and gold was saved thanks to the fire.\\nThe religious service was provisionally transferred to the Church of la Compañía, which was in charge of Mercedarian religious as a result of the recent expulsion of the Jesuits from America.\\nHowever, this very circumstance was the event that accelerated the work on the cathedral. In December 1775, a part of the new temple was enabled, and the religious service was transferred there.\\n\\n## The Neoclassical cathedral of Toesca and Cremonesi In 1775, Bishop Manuel de Alday presided over its consecration. Only five years later, the prelate entrusted the Italian architect Joaquín Toesca with the execution of the facades of the cathedral and the Church del Sagrario. Toesca redid the plans, beginning by directing the works in the damaged sector, next to the square, and modifying part of the area already built, with which the temple was architecturally enriched. Imposing the Neoclassical style, and remaining in the works for nearly 20 years, Toesca became the most important architect of the cathedral works.\\nAround 1830 the building was almost finished, and in 1840, Pope Gregory XVI turned it into a Metropolitan Cathedral, elevating the seat of Santiago to Archiepiscopal rank. The order or decree of erection was later lost, so Pope Pius IX allowed a new one to be made, leaving September 29, 1873 as the definitive date. In total, the work had taken nearly 80 years to be completed. and its cost amounted to 600,000 pesos.\\nIn 1846 the construction of the Sagrario Chapel began, which was finished by Eusebio Chelli. A year later, Archbishop Rafael Valentín Valdivieso commissioned Alexander Caldcleugh, a friend of the former treasurer of the Cathedral to buy an organ worthy of the cathedral building, while the National Congress approved the budget for it. In November 1849, the organ It arrived in Valparaíso by boat, and for its placement a choir had to be built over the main door of the cathedral, which in its first period was reinforced by fourteen English iron pillars arranged under it.\\nAt the end of the 19th century, Archbishop Mariano Casanova ordered a series of modifications that transformed the Cathedral into the building it currently exists. Casanova had decided to completely finish the construction of the cathedral, so he hired Ignacio Cremonesi and work began in 1898. Cremonesi\\'s design is inspired by a Tuscan or Roman style. In the transformations, the stone was covered with stucco and the wooden coffered ceiling was replaced by a sky painted with scenes in squares. The choir was first planned to be on the second level of pillars and beyond the arch. However, this meant that it was on the last ten rows of seats, so the idea was scrapped. The second option, and it was definitely left, was to leave it under the arch, which enormously increased the size of the choir but significantly restricted the sound capacity of the organ.\\nOn May 5, 1906, Casanova was finally able to consecrate the modified temple. Inside, the church was made up of three naves: two laterals and a taller central one. Cremonesi also added two towers to the façade.\\n\\n\\n## Description The main temple is made up of a plant with three naves. Its width is 45 meters and its length, from the façade to the doors facing Bandera street, is about 100 meters. This gives an area of about 4500 square meters.\\n\\n## Central nave In the central nave, the old main altar stands out at its bottom, crowned by a marble ciborium that preserves the crucifix inside, crowned by an eagle and guarded by angels, which was built in Munich in 1912, where masses were celebrated until that, between the 1960s and 1970s, in the archbishopric of Cardinal Raúl Silva Henríquez, a mobile wooden altar was made to celebrate Mass facing the town, but since it was not very decent for the surroundings, a front was placed in front of it silver 3 meters long. This altar was remodeled and modified between 2005 and 2006, in a work that involved the complete renovation of the presbytery and the total renovation of the archiepiscopal crypt. The mobile altar was replaced by a fixed one, the front of the mobile altar was destined for the Chapel of the Blessed Sacrament, and structural improvements were made to the presbytery.\\nAn ambon or wooden lectern in the shape of an eagle precedes the altar, going up the stairs of the presbytery. To its left, on the pilaster, there is a large crucifix, a donation from Pope Pius XI. Next, are the carved wooden seats, where the priests that make up the Metropolitan Council are located. In the middle of the left arm of the presbytery, under a wooden canopy, is the chair (wooden throne where the Archbishop sits during religious services). Right on the pilaster located in front of the canopy of the chair, there is a large painting that exhibits the coat of arms of the Archbishop in office.\\nIn the center of the presbytery is the new fixed altar, made up of a smooth block of granite, guarded by a set made up of a crucifix and six silver candlesticks, as required for the Pontifical Mass. Behind the new altar is the old high altar, already mentioned. At the end of the complex, next to the old altar on the right side, is the choir organ, a pipe organ built by the German Jesuits of Calera de Tango in 1754, and is still in use. In the central nave, the carved wooden pulpits from the 19th century also stand out.\\nOn the wall of the apse itself, there is in the upper part what we could call the main altarpiece, headed by a wooden image of the Assumption of Our Lady, patron saint of the cathedral, surrounded by angels and bronze rays, guarded by images of the Apostle Saint James the Great (patron of the city and of the archdiocese) and of Saint Rose of Lima, also in wood. Under this altarpiece, there is a window that illuminates the ciborium or manifestor where the crucifix is, and fills the central nave with light. At the feet, there is an image of Saint Francis Xavier recumbent. On its sides there are two doors that go out towards Bandera street, forming a simple rear façade.\\nOn the other hand, in the choir that is located above the main door, there is the great pipe organ made in the Flight & Son house in London. Since the 1980s, its sound capacity is totally null.\\n\\n## Archiepiscopal crypt Under the slab of the presbytery is the archiepiscopal crypt, where the archbishops of Santiago are commonly buried. Formerly the crypt was a dark and battered place but, at the initiative of Cardinal Carlos Oviedo Cavada, a project was drawn up to build a new one under the main altar, more worthy of preserving the remains of the prelates. Remodeled in 2005, it currently has a modern and sober appearance, headed by a colonial Christ in a crucifixion attitude and a small granite altar. To its sides are, in the walls, the niches where some of the bishops and archbishops of Santiago rest. In addition to the diocesan bishops and archbishops, other prelates rest, such as the apostolic nuncio, Monsignor Aldo Laghi, whose only nunciature was that of Chile, being ordained a bishop on September 18 (chosen by him in homage to Chile), and dying in this country according to his wish.\\nBehind the old main altar, the civil crypts of Diego Portales and José Tomás Ovalle are located.\\n\\n## Right nave =In the right nave, the tombs of great personalities of the country\\'s history stand out, of the first bishops and characters of the Criollo aristocracy.\\nNext to the right door of the Plaza de Armas is the monument and marble amphora where the hearts of the Chilean officers killed in the Battle of La Concepción in 1882 are preserved. It is neo-Gothic in style and white marble, and was inaugurated in 1912. Adjacent to the door of Calle Catedral is the carved wooden tombstone in memory of the Carrera brothers (Javiera, Juan José, José Miguel and Luis Carrera), whose tomb still remains unlocated inside the cathedral building. Also noteworthy for this nave are the tombs of Monsignor José Antonio Martínez de Aldunate, Bishop-elect of Santiago and Vice President of the First National Government Board; and that of Monsignor Joaquín Larraín Gandarillas, founder and first rector of the Pontifical Catholic University of Chile, inside a bronze sarcophagus.\\nIn this section there are eight side altars, dedicated to:\\n\\nSaint Francis of Paola.\\nSaint Francis de Sales, made of white, black and green marble.\\nSaint Alberto Hurtado\\nSaint Teresa of Jesus of the Andes, with relics of the saint.\\nTransfiguration of Jesus, with a copy of the homonymous painting by Raphael.\\nOur Lady of Mount Carmel, with a painting of the Virgin giving the scapular to the Carmelite Simon Stock (work by Jacques Pillard, made in Rome in 1864).\\nOur Lord Jesus Christ, where a relics of Saint Macrinus (or Macrobio), a martyr of the primitive Church, are kept.\\nSaint Peter\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n', 'EqXyHHDwjo4U', 'https://img.icons8.com/?size=150&id=EqXyHHDwjo4U', '', '#fffde8', '#99978b'], ['Plaza de Armas de Santiago', 'cultural_site', 'architecture', 'Santiago', 'Chile', 'https://www.google.com/maps/search/?api=1&query=Plaza%20de%20Armas%20de%20Santiago%20Pl.%20de%20Armas%2C%20Santiago%2C%20Regi%C3%B3n%20Metropolitana%2C%20Chile', 'https://citymapper.com/directions?endcoord=-33.4378941,-70.6510923&endname=Plaza%20de%20Armas%20de%20Santiago', '{\"place_id\":\"ChIJXYCenaPFYpYRdxnMjDaDNzI\",\"address_components\":[{\"types\":[\"route\"],\"long_name\":\"Plaza de Armas\",\"short_name\":\"Pl. de Armas\"},{\"long_name\":\"Santiago\",\"types\":[\"locality\",\"political\"],\"short_name\":\"Santiago\"},{\"types\":[\"administrative_area_level_3\",\"political\"],\"long_name\":\"Santiago\",\"short_name\":\"Santiago\"},{\"short_name\":\"Santiago\",\"long_name\":\"Santiago\",\"types\":[\"administrative_area_level_2\",\"political\"]},{\"long_name\":\"Región Metropolitana\",\"short_name\":\"Región Metropolitana\",\"types\":[\"administrative_area_level_1\",\"political\"]},{\"long_name\":\"Chile\",\"types\":[\"country\",\"political\"],\"short_name\":\"CL\"}],\"types\":[\"route\"],\"formatted_address\":\"Pl. de Armas, Santiago, Región Metropolitana, Chile\",\"geometry\":{\"location_type\":\"GEOMETRIC_CENTER\",\"location\":{\"lat\":-33.4378941,\"lng\":-70.6510923},\"bounds\":{\"northeast\":{\"lng\":-70.6495624,\"lat\":-33.4370051},\"southwest\":{\"lat\":-33.4386906,\"lng\":-70.6514213}},\"viewport\":{\"northeast\":{\"lat\":-33.4364988697085,\"lng\":-70.64914286970848},\"southwest\":{\"lat\":-33.4391968302915,\"lng\":-70.6518408302915}}}}', '-33.4378941', '-70.6510923', 'Plaza de Armas', 'Pl. de Armas', 'Pl. de Armas, Santiago, Región Metropolitana, Chile', 'GEOMETRIC_CENTER', 'ChIJXYCenaPFYpYRdxnMjDaDNzI', 'plaza de armas santiago chile', 'en', 'https://en.wikipedia.org/?curid=35907968', 'Plaza de Armas (Santiago)', '35907968', 'The <span class=\"searchmatch\">Plaza</span> <span class=\"searchmatch\">de</span> <span class=\"searchmatch\">Armas</span> is the main square of <span class=\"searchmatch\">Santiago</span>, the capital of <span class=\"searchmatch\">Chile</span>. <span class=\"searchmatch\">Plaza</span> <span class=\"searchmatch\">de</span> <span class=\"searchmatch\">Armas</span> metro station is located under the square.

Plaza de Armas metro station is located under the square. Surrounding the square are some historic buildings, including the Metropolitan Cathedral of Santiago, Central Post Office Building, Palacio de la Real Audiencia de Santiago, and the building that serves as the seat of local government for Santiago, which was formerly occupied by the Cabildo of the city before being remodeled. There are also other architecturally significant buildings that face the square, including the Capilla del Sagrario, the Palacio arzobispal, the Edificio Comercial Edwards, and the Portal Fernández Concha. The Casa Colorada, the Cuartel General del Cuerpo de Bomberos de Santiago and the Museo Chileno de Arte Precolombino are located a short walk from the square.\\nThe square, the nearby former National Congress building and surrounding buildings were registered on 3 December 1986 as a national monument as a zona típica.\\n\\n\\n## History The church is the centerpiece of the initial layout of Santiago, which has a square grid pattern. This urban design was accomplished by Pedro de Gamboa, who was appointed by Pedro de Valdivia in 1541.\\n\\n## Pre Hispanic Period (Pre Colonisation) =The Investigator Rubén Stehberg from the Museo Nacional de Historia Natural de Chile and Gonzalo Sotomayor of the Universidad Andrés Bello provided evidence in 1976, arguing that under the old city of Santiago where the Plaza de Armas is situated there is an old Inca settlement.There would have been a Tawantinsuyu (Inca Empire) urban centre, under the old city of Santiago, from which Inca roads went out in different directions and whose base of sustenance was hydro-agriculture and gold and silver mining, [...] the infrastructure of this installation would have been used by (the Spanish conqueror) Pedro de Valdivia to found the city of Santiago.\\n\\n## Spanish Colonial Period =The Chilean Capital was founded by Pedro de Valdivia. With a chequerboard format, similar to a Chess board, it was designed by the architect Pedro de Gamboa. It was thus planned to build a central square around which the main administrative buildings were to be erected. This square or plaza was erected above the old city or Cancha inca.\\nAround the plaza formed recovas or markets, as goods arrived in this area during the Colonial period. In the middle there was , galley para hang the sentenced and show royal power.\\n\\n\\n## Freedom of Latin America monument The monument is located at the center of the square and depicts an allegory of Freedom, with a woman breaking the chains of a native woman. It is made of Carrara marble and sculpted by Francesco Orselino. The monument replaced a bronze fountain made in 1671, which is presently located in La Moneda Palace.\\nOther commemorative structures include an equestrian statue of Pedro de Valdivia, a statue of James the Great, the indigenous peoples monument, a time capsule, and ground plaques, including that marking the kilometre zero of Santiago.\\n\\n\\n## Entorno \\nOn the west side of the square, on the northwest corner, is the Catedral Metropolitana de Santiago. Although the first construction of a church was carried out in conjunction with the founding of the city, the present building is the fifth to be built on the site. Construction began in 1748 and was completed in 1775. However, in 1780, the architect Joaquín Toesca designed a new façade for the Cathedral and the adjoining Iglesia del Sagrario. At the end of the century Ignacio Cremonesi was commissioned by Bishop Casanova to carry out an integral remodelling of the cathedral, which included new façades, a modification of the interior nave and the construction of two towers facing the square and a dome over the main altar.\\nFacing the north side of the Plaza are the old colonial government buildings. From west to east, the actual Correo Central, the Museo Histórico Nacional and the Ilustre Municipalidad de Santiago are located.\\nThe building of the Central Post Office of Santiago occupies the site assigned in the foundation to the conqueror Pedro de Valdivia, where later the residence of the Governors of Chile and, after independence, of the Presidents was built until 1846, when the presidential residence was moved to the Palace of La Moneda. However, a fire almost completely destroyed the building, and it was restored in 1881, giving it the neoclassical style it has today. In 1903 a third floor and an upper dome were built.\\nThe Museo Histórico Nacional is located in the former building of the Palacio de la Real Audiencia, the main colonial court in the country. Built between 1804 and 1807 by a disciple of Toesca, after the Independence of Chile it was the seat of various ministries until they were moved to La Moneda, as was the presidential residence. In 1982 the current museum was opened, bringing together various historical collections.\\nThe building of the Municipality occupies the site where the colonial cabildo of the city and the old colonial jail, built between 1578 and 1647, were originally built. In 1679, the second construction of the building was demolished and rebuilt by Toesca, now in neoclassical styles in 1790. A fire in 1891 forced a reconstruction by the architect Eugenio Joannon, and the new building was inaugurated in 1895 and officially declared the seat of the communal administration.\\nAround the Plaza there are also various commercial premises, such as the Portal Fernández Concha, located in front of the southern side of the Plaza. This shopping centre was built in 1869 and gathers both typical Chilean and international food shops and shops with different articles. In the area around the Cathedral, in the streets Puente and Catedral, there is an area that has been informally called \"Little Lima\" due to the large number of immigrants of Peruvian origin and commerce destined to serve them that has settled nearby.\\n', 'nxVWmOWM0rag', 'https://img.icons8.com/?size=150&id=nxVWmOWM0rag', '', '#fffde8', '#99978b'], ['Palácio La Moneda', 'cultural_site', 'architecture', 'Santiago', 'Chile', 'https://www.google.com/maps/search/?api=1&query=Pal%C3%A1cio%20La%20Moneda%20Moneda%2C%20Santiago%2C%20Regi%C3%B3n%20Metropolitana%2C%20Chile', 'https://citymapper.com/directions?endcoord=-33.4424189,-70.6539455&endname=Pal%C3%A1cio%20La%20Moneda', '{\"plus_code\":{\"global_code\":\"47RFH85W+2C\",\"compound_code\":\"H85W+2C Santiago, Chile\"},\"geometry\":{\"viewport\":{\"southwest\":{\"lat\":-33.4436762802915,\"lng\":-70.6553253302915},\"northeast\":{\"lat\":-33.44097831970851,\"lng\":-70.6526273697085}},\"location_type\":\"GEOMETRIC_CENTER\",\"location\":{\"lat\":-33.4424189,\"lng\":-70.65394549999999}},\"formatted_address\":\"Moneda, Santiago, Región Metropolitana, Chile\",\"address_components\":[{\"short_name\":\"Moneda\",\"types\":[\"route\"],\"long_name\":\"Moneda\"},{\"long_name\":\"Santiago\",\"types\":[\"locality\",\"political\"],\"short_name\":\"Santiago\"},{\"types\":[\"administrative_area_level_3\",\"political\"],\"short_name\":\"Santiago\",\"long_name\":\"Santiago\"},{\"types\":[\"administrative_area_level_2\",\"political\"],\"long_name\":\"Santiago\",\"short_name\":\"Santiago\"},{\"long_name\":\"Región Metropolitana\",\"types\":[\"administrative_area_level_1\",\"political\"],\"short_name\":\"Región Metropolitana\"},{\"types\":[\"country\",\"political\"],\"short_name\":\"CL\",\"long_name\":\"Chile\"}],\"place_id\":\"ChIJZeRH_abFYpYRgq6ITSuhD10\",\"types\":[\"establishment\",\"local_government_office\",\"point_of_interest\",\"tourist_attraction\"]}', '-33.4424189', '-70.6539455', 'Moneda', 'Moneda', 'Moneda, Santiago, Región Metropolitana, Chile', 'GEOMETRIC_CENTER', 'ChIJZeRH_abFYpYRgq6ITSuhD10', 'palacio la moneda santiago chile', 'en', 'https://en.wikipedia.org/?curid=483800', 'La Moneda Palace', '483800', '<span class=\"searchmatch\">Palacio</span> de <span class=\"searchmatch\">La</span> <span class=\"searchmatch\">Moneda</span> (Spanish: [paˈlasjo ðe <span class=\"searchmatch\">la</span> <span class=\"searchmatch\">moˈneða</span>], Palace of the Mint), or simply <span class=\"searchmatch\">La</span> <span class=\"searchmatch\">Moneda</span>, is the seat of the president of the Republic of Chile', 'https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/f/f5/Chile-02559_-_La_Moneda_Presidential_Palace_%2849033259257%29.jpg', '', '', '', 'La Moneda Palace', '# La Moneda Palace\\n---\\n\\nPalacio de La Moneda (Spanish: [paˈlasjo ðe la moˈneða], Palace of the Mint), or simply La Moneda, is the seat of the president of the Republic of Chile. It also houses the offices of three cabinet ministers: Interior, General Secretariat of the Presidency, and General Secretariat of the Government. Located in downtown Santiago, it occupies an entire block in the Civic District, bordered by Moneda street to the north, Morandé street to the east, Alameda del Libertador Bernardo O\\'Higgins to the south, and Teatinos street to the west.\\n\\n\\n## History La Moneda, was the colonial mint house of the city during colonial times, was designed by the Italian architect Joaquín Toesca. Construction began in 1784 and was opened in 1805. The production of coins in Chile took place at La Moneda from 1814 to 1929.\\n\\nIn June 1845 during president Manuel Bulnes\\'s administration, the palace became the seat of government and presidential residence. In 1930, a public square—named Plaza de la Constitución (\"Constitution Square\")—was built in front of the palace. After the presidency of Gabriel González Videla it ceased to serve as a presidential residence.\\nDuring the military coup d\\'état on September 11, 1973, the Chilean Air Force strafed the palace with unguided rockets and automatic cannon fire. The president Salvador Allende died in the palace at this time. Restoration projects of the damage caused were completed in March 1981, although some bullet marks have been preserved and can still be seen today. During the 1973–1980 restorations, an underground office complex (the so-called \"bunker\") was built under the front square to provide a safe escape for the dictator Augusto Pinochet in case of an attack.\\nUnder the presidency of Eduardo Frei Ruiz-Tagle, the palace was painted white. During President Ricardo Lagos\\'s administration, the palace\\'s inner courtyards were opened to the public during certain hours of the day. Lagos also re-opened Morandé 80—a gate used by Chilean presidents to enter the palace since the early 20th century. It was eliminated during the restoration of the palace as not being in the original plans, but was restored because of the heavy symbolism attached to it as being the gate through which Chilean Presidents entered La Moneda skipping the main\\'s gate guard protocol or, in other words, as ordinary citizens of the country. It was also the gate through which the body of President Allende was taken out after the 1973 coup.\\n\\nA traditional changing of the guard ceremony takes place every two days   on odd-numbered days in odd-numbered months, even-numbered days in even-numbered months, including Sundays, at 10 a.m. weekdays and 11 a.m. on weekends (as of June 2015).  A formal ceremony dating back to the 1850s, it lasts about 30 minutes and includes a band playing, troops with horses parading into the square, and much pomp and circumstance. The Carabineros de Chile provides the guard unit and band for the ceremony, the guard unit being composed of a Foot Guards battalion and a Horse Guards squadron.\\n\\n\\n## Architecture \\n## Construction =Joaquín Toesca had worked on many public buildings in colonial Chile, including the Santiago Metropolitan Cathedral, before he was engaged to design the new royal mint that would become the Palacio de la Moneda.\\nWorks on the building started in 1784, with building materials arriving the following year from around Chile and the world: limestone from the Polpaico country estate; sand from the Maipo River; red stones from a quarry at the Cerro San Cristóbal in Santiago; white stone from the neighbouring Cerro Blanco; oak and cypress wood from Valdivia; Spanish metal works from Vizcaya. Twenty varieties of brick were baked in Santiago for the construction of lintels, comers, floors, moldings, and of the solid walls more than a meter thick.\\nToesca died in 1799, before seeing his work finished, and military engineer Agustin Cavallero took over the project. The “Mint House of Santiago de Chile” finally opened in 1805.\\nIn 1929, an annex was commissioned the then President Carlos Ibáñez del Campo to give the palace a facade to face the Alameda Avenue, the main street of Santiago. The project was designed by Josué Smith strictly following the design of the original construction. The three-floor annex was built using part of the original construction that was occupied until that date by the mint, which was relocated to a site adjacent to Quinta Normal Park.\\nIn 1940, a former mint pavilion, part of the original design of Toesca, was demolished to make way for the Patio de los Naranjos.\\n\\n## Architectural style =The Palacio de la Moneda is built in a pure neoclassical style with Roman Doric influences. The building\\'s wide, horizontal shape and rectangular composition conveys strength and stability, according to the palace\\'s listing on the UNESCO website. Its main façade faces Moneda street, and its rooms are distributed along the transverse and longitudinal axes forming several patios.\\nBehind this façade lie three patios: the Patio de los Cañones, which functions as an entrance hall; a covered patio; and finally the Patio de los Naranjos, where presidential ceremonies take place.\\nThe architecture website ARQHYS.com states that the Palacio de la Moneda is “the only structure in the pure Italian neoclassical style that exists in Latin America.” \\nThe building has been subject to several modifications throughout the years, made by different presidents. The last great restoration of the building was carried out after the 1973 military coup, when large portions of the building were destroyed or damaged.\\n\\n## Plaza de la Ciudadanía =To celebrate the bicentenary of Chile\\'s independence in 2010, a new public square called the Plaza de la Ciudadanía (‘’Citizenry Square’’ in Spanish) was constructed on the south side of the palace stretching down to the Avenida Libertador General Bernardo O\\'Higgins or “Alameda”. Construction began in May 2004 and the plaza was inaugurated in December 2005.\\nDesigned by Undurraga Devés Arquitectos, the Plaza de la Ciudadanía has been called “one of the most important public works in the last century” by Chile\\'s Plataforma Arquitectura website. Paths leading down from the plaza give access to the underground Palacio de La Moneda Cultural Center, which hosts a range of exhibitions on Chilean culture and history.\\n', 'nxVWmOWM0rag', 'https://img.icons8.com/?size=150&id=nxVWmOWM0rag', '', '#fffde8', '#99978b'], ['Museu Chileno de Arte Pré-Colombiana', 'cultural_site', 'museum', 'Santiago', 'Chile', 'https://www.google.com/maps/search/?api=1&query=Museu%20Chileno%20de%20Arte%20Pr%C3%A9-Colombiana%20Bandera%20361%2C%208320298%20Santiago%2C%20Regi%C3%B3n%20Metropolitana%2C%20Chile', 'https://citymapper.com/directions?endcoord=-33.4386677,-70.6523921&endname=Museu%20Chileno%20de%20Arte%20Pr%C3%A9-Colombiana', '{\"plus_code\":{\"global_code\":\"47RFH86X+G2\",\"compound_code\":\"H86X+G2 Santiago, Chile\"},\"types\":[\"establishment\",\"museum\",\"point_of_interest\",\"tourist_attraction\"],\"geometry\":{\"location_type\":\"ROOFTOP\",\"viewport\":{\"northeast\":{\"lat\":-33.4376252197085,\"lng\":-70.65102666970849},\"southwest\":{\"lat\":-33.44032318029149,\"lng\":-70.6537246302915}},\"location\":{\"lat\":-33.4386677,\"lng\":-70.6523921}},\"address_components\":[{\"long_name\":\"361\",\"types\":[\"street_number\"],\"short_name\":\"361\"},{\"types\":[\"route\"],\"short_name\":\"Bandera\",\"long_name\":\"Bandera\"},{\"long_name\":\"Santiago\",\"types\":[\"locality\",\"political\"],\"short_name\":\"Santiago\"},{\"short_name\":\"Santiago\",\"long_name\":\"Santiago\",\"types\":[\"administrative_area_level_3\",\"political\"]},{\"long_name\":\"Santiago\",\"types\":[\"administrative_area_level_2\",\"political\"],\"short_name\":\"Santiago\"},{\"short_name\":\"Región Metropolitana\",\"types\":[\"administrative_area_level_1\",\"political\"],\"long_name\":\"Región Metropolitana\"},{\"long_name\":\"Chile\",\"short_name\":\"CL\",\"types\":[\"country\",\"political\"]},{\"long_name\":\"8320298\",\"types\":[\"postal_code\"],\"short_name\":\"8320298\"}],\"place_id\":\"ChIJ58cpbKTFYpYRw3pfdBEEHEQ\",\"formatted_address\":\"Bandera 361, 8320298 Santiago, Región Metropolitana, Chile\"}', '-33.4386677', '-70.6523921', 'Bandera', 'Bandera', 'Bandera 361, 8320298 Santiago, Región Metropolitana, Chile', 'ROOFTOP', 'ChIJ58cpbKTFYpYRw3pfdBEEHEQ', 'Museo Chileno de Arte Precolombino', 'en', 'https://en.wikipedia.org/?curid=20174054', 'Museo Chileno de Arte Precolombino', '20174054', 'The Chilean Museum of Pre-Columbian Art (Spanish: <span class=\"searchmatch\">Museo</span> <span class=\"searchmatch\">Chileno</span> <span class=\"searchmatch\">de</span> <span class=\"searchmatch\">Arte</span> <span class=\"searchmatch\">Precolombino</span>) is an art museum dedicated to the study and display of pre-Columbian', '#REF!', '', '', '', 'Museo Chileno de Arte Precolombino', \"# Museo Chileno de Arte Precolombino\\n---\\n\\nThe Chilean Museum of Pre-Columbian Art (Spanish: Museo Chileno de Arte Precolombino) is an art museum dedicated to the study and display of pre-Columbian artworks and artifacts from Central and South America.\\nThe museum is located in the city centre of Santiago, the capital of Chile. The museum was founded by the Chilean architect and antiquities collector Sergio Larraín García-Moreno, who had sought premises for the display and preservation of his private collection of pre-Columbian artefacts acquired over the course of nearly fifty years. \\nWith the support of Santiago's municipal government at the time, García-Moreno secured the building and established the museum's curatorial institution.

It is located a block west of the Plaza de Armas and close to the Palacio de los Tribunales de Justicia de Santiago and the Former National Congress Building.\\nIn January 2014, as a result of a partnership with Minera Escondida and BHP Billiton, the museum inaugurated a new phase designed by Chilean architect Smiljan Radic which involved a 70% expansion of the area, increasing exhibition spaces, storage, and the conservation laboratory.\\n\\n\\n## Collection \\nItems in the museum's collections are drawn from the major pre-Columbian culture areas of Mesoamerica, Intermediate / Isthmo-Colombian, Pan-Caribbean, Amazonia and the Andean. The museum has over 3,000 pieces representing almost 100 different groups of people. The collection ranges from about 10,000 years. The original collection was acquired based on the aesthetic quality of the objects, instead of their scientific or historical context. The collection is broken up into four areas:\\n\\nArea mesoamerica: Includes a statue of Xipe Totec, an incense burner from the Teotihuacan culture, and a Mayan bas-relief.\\nArea Intermedia: Showcase pieces include pottery from the Valdivia people, and Capuli figures chewing coca leaf. Gold objects from the Veraguas and Diquis cultures are also represented.\\nArea Andes Centrales: Features masks and copper figures, of which many were confiscated from graves.

Concha y Toro Winery is located in Santiago de Chile, but the company has vineyards in Chile, Argentina and the United States, with more than 10,000 hectares under cultivation in 2016. Their Casillero del Diablo and Don Melchor wines have international recognition. As of 2010 the company is one of the official sponsors of the English football club Manchester United F. C.\\n\\n\\n## History \\n## 19th century The Concha y Toro Vineyard was founded by Don Melchor de Santiago Concha y Toro, ex-Minister of Finance, and his wife, Emiliana Subercaseaux, in 1883. To start the winery, he brought grape varieties from the Bordeaux region in France: Cabernet Sauvignon, Sauvignon Blanc, Semillon, Merlot, and Carménère.\\nConcha y Toro\\'s connections to Chilean nobility and aristocracy are not merely historical. Currently the Vina Concha y Toro continues in the sphere of the Marquesado de Casa Concha, and is additionally controlled by the Guilisasti and Larraín families. The directors currently include the present Marquess of Casa Concha, Chilean diplomat and ambassador Mariano Fontecilla de Santiago-Concha, great-grandson of the founder. In 1999, the company\\'s president Alfonso Larraín Santa María claimed the title of Marquess of Larraín in Spain. His mother, the current Marchioness, gave Larraín the power to claim the title.\\nVineyards and factories of Concha y Toro in Pirque, Santiago Metropolitan Region, are connected by roads with names such as Marqués de Casa Concha or Conde de la Conquista, titles connected to the history of the company.\\n\\n## 20th century: expansion =The vineyard was incorporated as a stock company in 1923 and shares continue to be sold in the Santiago Stock Exchange. Concha y Toro began exporting wine in March 1933 to the port of Rotterdam, the Netherlands. In 1950, the winery began to acquire more vineyards and also began the process of adapting its business to new markets and meeting a higher demand.\\nIn 1966, the Casillero del Diablo brand, the company\\'s hallmark, was inaugurated, and in 1987 the company\\'s first ultra-premium wine, Don Melchor, was launched. In the late 1960s the company began to expand: Viña Maipo was acquired in 1968; Viña Cono Sur created in 1993; Trivento Bodegas in Argentina founded in 1996; a joint venture with Château Mouton Rothschild for the production of Viña Almaviva began in 1997, among others.\\nIn 1971, Eduardo Guilisasti Tagle became chairman of the board, who succeeded in expanding the company. In 1987, after partnering with U.S. importer Banfi Vintners, the company started to incorporate more advanced technology in all of its production stages. It also started using small French oak barriques. In 1994, shares of Viña Concha started trading on the New York Stock Exchange, until his cessation in 2018.\\n\\n## 21st century: globalization =At the beginning of the 21st century, the company internationalized operations: in 2001 opened a trade, logistics and distribution office in United Kingdom, and then offices in other 11 countries: Brazil, Canada, China, United States, Finland, Japan, Mexico, Norway, Singapore, South Africa and Sweden, which would join the existing offices in Chile and Argentina. In 2010 a sponsorship agreement was signed with the English club Manchester United F.C. In this respect, Manchester United 2020 sponsorship director, Sean Jefferson, said: \"Manchester United\\'s relationship with Casillero del Diablo has been one of the most extensive and successful partnerships we ever had. The synergy between the two brands have led to a natural alliance\", especially due to equivalence of their symbols and distinctive seals.\\nIn 2011 Concha y Toro bought in United States Fetzer Vineyards, for a value of US$238 million. The transaction included the buy of various Fetzer subsidiaries vineyards, such as Bonterra Vineyards, Five River Wines, Bel Arbor Winery, Jekel Vineyards, and Little Black Dress Wines, which became property of Concha y Toro.\\nMore recently Concha y Toro has advertising campaigns in Discovery Channel, and subsidiary Trivento Vineyards is sponsorship in the Major League Soccer, and has reached sponsorship agreements with football club Inter Miami CF.\\n\\n\\n## Grape varieties Concha y Toro produces several varietals:\\n\\nWhite: Chardonnay, Sauvignon blanc, Semillon, Gewürztraminer.\\nRed: Cabernet Sauvignon, Merlot, Carménère\\n\\n## Filial vineyards =\\n## Logistics centers =\\n## Trademarks \\n## Awards and honours The World\\'s Most Admired Wine Brand, in 2011, 2012 and 2013; second place in 2014, 2017 and 2018, according Drink International.\\nThe Americas Most Admired Wine Brand, between 2011 and 2019, according Drink International.\\nThe World\\'s Most Powerful Wine Brand, in 2014 and 2015, according to Intangible Business.\\nOne of the only three wineries to be included in the top 100 of the best wineries in the world without interruption, according to Wine & Spirits Magazine.\\nBest International Drink Company of the year, in 2015 and 2016, awarded by the Drinks Business Awards.\\nCasillero del Diablo, Second Most Powerful Wine Brand in the World, in 2018, 2019 and 2020, according to Wine Intelligence.\\n', 'toxe7lzrsfSS', 'https://img.icons8.com/?size=150&id=toxe7lzrsfSS', '', '#e8fffa', '#8b9996'], ['Bairro París-Londres', 'site', 'neighbourhood', 'Santiago', 'Chile', 'https://www.google.com/maps/search/?api=1&query=Bairro%20Par%C3%ADs-Londres%20Par%C3%ADs%20%26%20Londres%2C%208330129%20Santiago%2C%20Regi%C3%B3n%20Metropolitana%2C%20Chile', 'https://citymapper.com/directions?endcoord=-33.4446231,-70.6484288&endname=Bairro%20Par%C3%ADs-Londres', '{\"address_components\":[{\"types\":[\"intersection\"],\"long_name\":\"París & Londres\",\"short_name\":\"París & Londres\"},{\"types\":[\"locality\",\"political\"],\"long_name\":\"Santiago\",\"short_name\":\"Santiago\"},{\"long_name\":\"Santiago\",\"types\":[\"administrative_area_level_3\",\"political\"],\"short_name\":\"Santiago\"},{\"long_name\":\"Santiago\",\"types\":[\"administrative_area_level_2\",\"political\"],\"short_name\":\"Santiago\"},{\"short_name\":\"Región Metropolitana\",\"long_name\":\"Región Metropolitana\",\"types\":[\"administrative_area_level_1\",\"political\"]},{\"types\":[\"country\",\"political\"],\"long_name\":\"Chile\",\"short_name\":\"CL\"},{\"types\":[\"postal_code\"],\"short_name\":\"8330129\",\"long_name\":\"8330129\"}],\"formatted_address\":\"París & Londres, 8330129 Santiago, Región Metropolitana, Chile\",\"place_id\":\"EkBQYXLDrXMgJiBMb25kcmVzLCA4MzMwMTI5IFNhbnRpYWdvLCBSZWdpw7NuIE1ldHJvcG9saXRhbmEsIENoaWxlImYiZAoUChIJB9NvYqDFYpYRSdVaBAwjMa0SFAoSCQfTb2KgxWKWEUnVWgQMIzGtGhQKEgnZnLtvoMVilhEC7eIXTs-luRoUChIJD4w9Y6DFYpYRs-o_iVU2u2IiCg1pwRDsFcDn49U\",\"types\":[\"intersection\"],\"partial_match\":true,\"geometry\":{\"location_type\":\"GEOMETRIC_CENTER\",\"viewport\":{\"northeast\":{\"lng\":-70.6470798197085,\"lat\":-33.44327411970851},\"southwest\":{\"lat\":-33.4459720802915,\"lng\":-70.6497777802915}},\"location\":{\"lat\":-33.4446231,\"lng\":-70.64842879999999}}}', '-33.4446231', '-70.6484288', '', '', 'París & Londres, 8330129 Santiago, Región Metropolitana, Chile', 'GEOMETRIC_CENTER', 'EkBQYXLDrXMgJiBMb25kcmVzLCA4MzMwMTI5IFNhbnRpYWdvLCBSZWdpw7NuIE1ldHJvcG9saXRhbmEsIENoaWxlImYiZAoUChIJB9NvYqDFYpYRSdVaBAwjMa0SFAoSCQfTb2KgxWKWEUnVWgQMIzGtGhQKEgnZnLtvoMVilhEC7eIXTs-luRoUChIJD4w9Y6DFYpYRs-o_iVU2u2IiCg1pwRDsFcDn49U', 'Bairro Paris-Londres Chile', 'pt', 'https://pt.wikipedia.org/?curid=2351724', 'Bairro Paris-Londres', '2351724', 'O <span class=\"searchmatch\">Bairro</span> <span class=\"searchmatch\">Paris</span>-<span class=\"searchmatch\">Londres</span> é um <span class=\"searchmatch\">bairro</span> localizado em Santiago de <span class=\"searchmatch\">Chile</span> dentro da comuna homônima em seu setor central.

Uma de suas características é seu marcado estilo arquitetônico europeu e suas sinuosas ruas estreitas de ladrilhos. Foi desenhado por Ernesto Holzmann filho e padre.\\n\\n\\n## História Os terrenos atuais onde se assenta o bairro pertenciam aos monges franciscanos da Igreja de São Francisco, localizada na interseção da Avenida Libertador General Bernardo O'Higgins e São Francisco. A começos do Século XX, os problemas econômicos da igreja a obrigaram a por a venda aqueles prédios centrais e agrícolas a particulares. A situação foi conhecida por autoridades da época (década de 1920) e decidiram adquirir parte dos terrenos, encarregando-lhe a famosos arquitetos do velho continente a desenhar e construir suas obras.\\n\\n\\n## Características O setor se encontra compreendido pelo norte pela Alameda, ao leste pela Rua São Francisco, pelo sul com a Rua Tarapacá e ao oeste com a Rua Serrano. As ruas interiores, como Paris e Londres, tendem a ser sinuosas, em câmbio outras são retas, como São Francisco e Presidente J. A. Ríos. As construções não superam os cinco andares de altura e as ruas estão empedradas com ladrilhos.\\nO comercio é muito escasso e é mais bem considerado um lugar de turismo, pois os albergues abundam e a maioria dos edifícios são lugares de trabalho e moradia.\\n\\n## Edifícios destacados =Na zona se localizam uma serie de edifícios que merecem certa menção:\\n\\nNa interseção das Ruas Paris e Londres está localizada a Sede da Concertación (de propriedade do PRSD), atual coalizão do governo do Chile. Neste lugar se realizam as reuniões de coordenação nas segundas e as conferências de imprensa.\\nNa rua Londres, perpendicular a Alameda, se encontra a atual sede do Instituto O'Higginiano, no número 40. Este imóvel era antes do Golpe de estado no Chile em 1973 uma sede comunal do Partido Socialista do Chile. Ocupado pela DINA com posterioridade, se transformou em um centro de detenção e tortura até a abertura do campo de concentração de Villa Grimaldi. Era conhecido com sua direção de então, Londres 38, sendo seu nome clave dentro do Exército o de Yucatán. Foi transferido então gratuitamente ao Instituto O'Higginiano, organismo vinculado com o Exército do Chile, quem o administra desde então, pese a os protestos de grupos defensores dos direitos humanos. O imóvel foi declarado Monumento Nacional do Chile.\\nNa Rua Londres 65 se encontra o Instituto Chileno de Investigações Genealógicas, onde também funciona sua biblioteca especializada em genealogia chilena.\\n\\n\\n## Ligações externas «Panorâmica em 360º do Bairro Paris-Londres  Flip360»\", 'j05edJz5Xwy0', 'https://img.icons8.com/?size=150&id=j05edJz5Xwy0', '', '#f5f5f5', '#939393'], ['Barrio Lastarria', 'site', 'neighbourhood', 'Santiago', 'Chile', 'https://www.google.com/maps/search/?api=1&query=Barrio%20Lastarria%20Lastarria%2C%20Santiago%2C%20Regi%C3%B3n%20Metropolitana%2C%20Chile', 'https://citymapper.com/directions?endcoord=-33.4382715,-70.6410854&endname=Barrio%20Lastarria', '{\"types\":[\"neighborhood\",\"political\"],\"geometry\":{\"location_type\":\"APPROXIMATE\",\"bounds\":{\"southwest\":{\"lng\":-70.6447089,\"lat\":-33.4422048},\"northeast\":{\"lat\":-33.4359786,\"lng\":-70.6365844}},\"location\":{\"lat\":-33.4382715,\"lng\":-70.6410854},\"viewport\":{\"northeast\":{\"lat\":-33.4359786,\"lng\":-70.6365844},\"southwest\":{\"lng\":-70.6447089,\"lat\":-33.4422048}}},\"address_components\":[{\"long_name\":\"Lastarria\",\"short_name\":\"Lastarria\",\"types\":[\"neighborhood\",\"political\"]},{\"short_name\":\"Santiago\",\"types\":[\"locality\",\"political\"],\"long_name\":\"Santiago\"},{\"long_name\":\"Santiago\",\"types\":[\"administrative_area_level_3\",\"political\"],\"short_name\":\"Santiago\"},{\"long_name\":\"Santiago\",\"types\":[\"administrative_area_level_2\",\"political\"],\"short_name\":\"Santiago\"},{\"types\":[\"administrative_area_level_1\",\"political\"],\"long_name\":\"Región Metropolitana\",\"short_name\":\"Región Metropolitana\"},{\"long_name\":\"Chile\",\"types\":[\"country\",\"political\"],\"short_name\":\"CL\"}],\"place_id\":\"ChIJBWlI4us9YpYRBEZ29RDQjqM\",\"formatted_address\":\"Lastarria, Santiago, Región Metropolitana, Chile\"}', '-33.4382715', '-70.6410854', '', '', 'Lastarria, Santiago, Región Metropolitana, Chile', 'APPROXIMATE', 'ChIJBWlI4us9YpYRBEZ29RDQjqM', 'barrio lastarria  santiago chile', 'en', 'https://en.wikipedia.org/?curid=37701573', 'Barrio Lastarria', '37701573', '<span class=\"searchmatch\">Barrio</span> <span class=\"searchmatch\">Lastarria</span> (<span class=\"searchmatch\">Lastarria</span> Neighborhood) is an historical neighborhood in the center of <span class=\"searchmatch\">Santiago</span>, <span class=\"searchmatch\">Chile</span>.

Now a popular tourist hub, Barrio Lastarria is a center for cultural activity, with cinemas, theaters, museums, restaurants and bars. Activities such as festivals and live performances are commonly held throughout the streets of Lastarria given its strong cultural flavor, particularly in J.V. Lastarria street and Parque Forestal.\\nBarrio Lastarria is bordered by the Alameda and Centro Cultural Gabriela Mistral to the south, Santa Lucía Hill to the west, Parque Forestal to the north and Plaza Baquedano to the east. Metro stations Universidad Católica and Bellas Artes provide direct access.\\n\\n\\n## History Following the Conquest of Chile by Pedro de Valdivia, this area was left under the control of Bartolomé Blumenthal, a German migrant to Chile, who built a mill on the site. As with many neighborhoods in Santiago’s center, Barrio Lastarria was built around a church: in this case, the Iglesia de la Veracruz. Houses were built between the winding streets, notably the house at Plaza Mulato Gil de Castro, built in the beginning of the 19th century. Despite the neighborhood’s early origins, the plaza was only built in 1981 due to interest in preserving a series of facades beginning at the historic house of Gil de Castro.\\nDuring the 1990s, the neighborhood began a process of restoration with care not to alter its bohemian and intellectual flavor, with a number of cafés, bars and cultural centers appearing towards the end of the decade and the restoration of facades of the Iglesia de la Veracruz in 2001 and 2002. Since then, as an historic area in Santiago, it has been able to maintain its traditional character despite new development. Barrio Lastarria was declared an official Zona Típica by Chile in 1997.\\nDue to both the number of visitors and LGBT residents, on 5 November 2006, the Movement for Homosexual Integration and Liberation (Movilh) held an act in Parque Forestal to declare the sector as the first gay-friendly neighborhood in Santiago.\\n\\n\\n## Places of interest Cafés, cinemas and museums in J.V.

It is situated between Alameda del Libertador Bernardo O\\'Higgins in the south, Santa Lucía Street in the west and Victoria Subercaseaux on the east. An adjacent metro station is named after it.  The hill has an altitude of 629 m and a height of 69 m over the surrounding area.  The hill is the remnant of a volcano 15 million years old.\\nThe hill comprises a 65,300 square metre park adorned with ornate facades, stairways and fountains. At the highest point there is a viewpoint popular with tourists visiting the city and meeting point.\\n\\n\\n## History It was originally called Huelito o heutrecan by the pre-colonization inhabitants. However, the current name comes from the day in which Pedro de Valdivia conquered the hill, on December 13, 1540. That day celebrates \"Santa Lucía.\"\\nIts first use by its missionaries was as a point of worship, or prayer in the years of the chicken pox outbreak (1541).\\nIn 1816, Manuel Olaguer Feliú, the Brigadier of the Royal Engineers, designed and built two forts or castles on Santa Lucía Hill, one north and the other south of the hill. The forts were built out of stone and lime and could fit eight or twelve cannons each. Besides, Olaguer Feliú drew and built an outbuilding for ammunition depot and to house the garrison.\\nOn one side of the hill, Fort Hidalgo was finished in 1820 as a defensive point. On the other side, the hillside terrain was used as a \"cemetery for the dissidents\", people who did not follow the then-official Roman Catholic faith, or were considered otherwise unworthy of burial at hallowed grounds. However, the remains buried in the hillside under this fashion were eventually transferred to a secluded section of the General Cemetery, before said cemetery, in turn, was opened to all burials regardless of creed or social condition.\\nIn 1849 James Melville Gilliss led an American naval astronomical expedition to Chile in order to more precisely measure the solar parallax. An observatory was set up on Santa Lucía Hill and operated by Gilliss. When the expedition ended in September 1852 the observatory and related equipment was sold to the Chilean government and formed the nucleus of the first National Astronomical Observatory.\\nIn 1872 Benjamín Vicuña Mackenna decided to conduct a dramatic change to the urban atmosphere of the city of Santiago, among his many works aimed to improve the city, and thus initiated an extensive remodelation of the hill.\\nThe works of 1872 consisted of a road which crossed the hill, which at the top accessed a chapel which he also built there, illuminated by the then-novel means of gas. The rest of the hill contains a park with fountains and lookouts. The actual hill is watered by a sophisticated irrigation system. The now iconic yellow and white facade is also a product of Vicuña Mackenna\\'s remodelation.\\nVicuña Mackenna was assisted in realizing his designs by the architect Manuel Aldunate, the constructor Enrique Henes, and the stonecutter Andrés Staimbuck.\\nA few years ago, Santa Lucía hill received an improvement in its illumination system and protections.

In the house, there is a 1955 painting Matilde by Diego Rivera.  It was given to Urrutia by Neruda. It depicted a two-faced Urrutia, one face depicting the Urrutia as the singer the public knew, and the other depicting the lover Neruda knew. The painting also has a hidden image; the profile view of Neruda's face hidden in her hair, showing their continuous secret relationship.

It rises 850 m AMSL and about 300 m above the rest of Santiago; the peak is the third highest point in the city, after Cerro Manquehue and Cerro Renca. Cerro San Cristóbal was named by the Spanish conquistadors for St Christopher, in recognition of its use as a landmark. Its original indigenous name is Tupahue.\\n\\n\\n## History and attractions Cerro San Cristóbal began to be used in 1903 with the installation of the Mills Observatory, currently known as the Manuel Foster Observatory, twin of the Lick Observatory of the University of California.\\nOn its summit there is a sanctuary dedicated to the Immaculate Conception, with a 22-meter statue of the Blessed Virgin Mary, an amphitheater and a chapel. The statue of the Immaculate Conception measures 14 meters tall, and the pedestal on which it rests is 8.3 meters in height. It weighs 36,610 kilograms. Within the pedestal there is a small chapel in which Pope John Paul II prayed and blessed the city of Santiago on April 1, 1987. The statue is lit up at night by lights placed on its sides, allowing it to be viewed from all over Santiago both day and night.\\nAt the foot of the statue there is an amphitheater for holding masses or other religious ceremonies. Near the statue, there is also a small chapel for praying.\\nAt the foothills of Cerro San Cristóbal are the Chilean National Zoo and a Japanese-style garden, and up there are also two municipal pools, Tupahue and Antilén.\\nCerro San Cristóbal houses Santiago's largest public park: the Santiago Metropolitan Park (Parque Metropolitano).\\n\\n\\n## Access The summit of Cerro San Cristóbal can be reached by foot (about a 45-minute walk, involving a 300m change in elevation), by car via the road joining the Santiago Metropolitan Park, by the Funicular de Santiago (the base of which sits next to the Zoo at the North end of Pio Nono in Barrio Bellavista), or by a Teleferico (cable car located northeast at the Oasis station).\\nA cable car provided service to the top of the hill from the Pedro de Valdivia entrance since 1980 until 2009, when the gearbox controlling the system's speed exploded, leaving the system unusable. A project was presented in 2011 to open for tender on the system, giving it new cabins and restore infrastructure. The service was expected to be back in 2012, however the Ministry of Housing and Urban Planning received only one offer that was rejected, so the tender was ended and a new public contest was announced, that began in 2013.Then, in December 2014 it was announced that the cable car would re-open in the second semester of 2016 after a series of maintenance and remodeling works to be done from March 2015, costing US$9.5 million. These works complete the installation of the new 46 cabin network, of which 8 will be enabled for the transport of bicycles, strollers or wheelchairs. The transport cabins have a 6-person capacity and the system was reopened in November 2016.\\nFrom the top of the hill are two pools – Tupahue and Antilén, and access the National Zoo of Chile at the Bellavista entrance to Cerro San Cristóbal. The Children's Park of Cerro San Cristóbal also provides entrance to the hill via Avenida Perú.\\n\", 'M0ClAYLFXhjv', 'https://img.icons8.com/?size=150&id=M0ClAYLFXhjv', '', '#e8ffe9', '#8b998b'], ['Sky Costanera', 'tour', 'skyscraper', 'Santiago', 'Chile', 'https://www.google.com/maps/search/?api=1&query=Sky%20Costanera%20Av.%20Andr%C3%A9s%20Bello%202425%2C%207510689%20Providencia%2C%20Regi%C3%B3n%20Metropolitana%2C%20Chile', 'https://citymapper.com/directions?endcoord=-33.4177363,-70.6064265&endname=Sky%20Costanera', '{\"address_components\":[{\"long_name\":\"2425\",\"types\":[\"street_number\"],\"short_name\":\"2425\"},{\"types\":[\"route\"],\"short_name\":\"Av.

In September, 2012, the Chilean government launched a plan to significantly refurbish and expand the park between 2012 and 2016, a plan which includes building new footpaths, planting 100,000 more trees and expanding the National Zoo.\\n\\n\\n## Origins and history \\nSan Cristóbal Hill began to be used in 1903 with the installation of the Mills Observatory, currently known as the Manuel Foster Observatory, twin of the Lick Observatory of the University of California.\\nThe main icon on the hill, the Statue of the Virgin Mary on San Cristóbal Hill, was inaugurated on April 26, 1908.\\nIn 1916, a project led by Alberto Mackenna Subercaseaux and Pedro Bannen sought to transform the hill into a park and public recreational area. On September 28, 1917, Law No. 3295 was published in the Official Gazette which authorized president Juan Luis Sanfuentes to accept donations, purchase or expropriate land located between Bosque Santiago and San Cristóbal Hill, inclusive. Said land was declared for public use and the creation of the future park.\\nThe then Intendant of Santiago, Pablo Urzúa, took official possession of the park's land on June 17, 1918. It was however during the period of intendant Alberto Mackenna, between 1921 and 1927, that the Hill was landscaped and prepared for public use.\\n\\n\\n## Attractions \\n## Pools The park has two open-air pools: the Tupahue pool (meaning “place of God” in Quechua) and Antilén pool (“there is sun” in Mapundungun). Both operate in the summer from November through March.\\nThe Tupahue pool was opened in 1966 on Tupahue hill, in what was originally a quarry. Surrounded by vegetation, there is a stone wall by Chilean muralist María Martner and Mexican Juan O’Gorman. The pool is 82 meters long and 25 meters wide.\\nThe Antilén pool was opened in 1976. It is located on the summit of Chacarillas hill with a 360-degree panoramic view of the city. The pool is 92 meters long and 25 meters wide.\\n\\n## Cable car =The Santiago Cable Car was opened in 1980 and takes visitors from the base of the hill, in Pedro de Valdivia Norte neighborhood (Estación Oasis) to the summit (Estación Cumbre) in 20 minutes, passing through Tupahue station. The Tupahue pool is located at Estación Tupahue, as is the Mapulemu Botanic Garden (“forest of the earth” in Mapundungun) and the Camino Real restaurant.\\nAt the summit, tourists can visit the Sanctuary on San Cristóbal Hill and take the Funicular, which runs between Barrio Bellavista and the summit of San Cristóbal Hill.\\nAs of 2012, the Cable Car remains closed due to mechanical failures. Its restoration has been marked as part of the government's Bicentenary Plan.\\nIn December 2014, it was announced that the cable car would be reopening in 2016 with work on the project starting in March 2015. The project will cost 9.5 million dollars. The cable car was reopened in November 2016.\\n\\n## Funicular =The Funicular de Santiago, which dates from 1925, has been declared a National Monument. It has two stations:  the National Zoo and  the summit. The funicular runs for almost 500 meters on a 45 degree incline, departing from Barrio Bellavista.\\nThe funicular has two carriages, with one displaying a memorial plaque commemorating Pope John Paul II, who rode in the carriage in 1987 en route to saying mass at the feet of the Virgin Mary statue located at the hill's summit.\\nIn September 2012, the funicular was marked for refurbishment as part of the Chilean government's Bicentenary Plan.\\n\\n## National Zoo =The Chilean National Zoo has thousands of animals representing 158 species.\\n\\n## Botanical Garden Located within the park, the Botanical Garden contains various plants native to Chile and its mission includes conservation and research.\\n\\n## Sanctuary A religious sanctuary atop San Cristóbal Hill commemorating the Immaculate Conception, is notable for its large statue of the Virgin Mary.\\n\\n## Bicentenary Children's Park =This park was opened in  2012 and has an amphitheater, treehouses, water features, interactive fence and a cable car.\\n\\n\\n## Torre Antena \\nAs it stands today, there are numerous Radio Antennas on the top of the hill that have become an eyesore. The Government of Santiago has come up with a solution to tear down all the existing antennas and instead combine them in one giant antenna that would also serve as a new landmark for Santiago. In late 2013 the city held a design contest for the new tower with the winning bid being announced in February of the following year.\\n\", 'Ah17OpXv85zO', 'https://img.icons8.com/?size=150&id=Ah17OpXv85zO', '', '#e8ffe9', '#8b998b'], ['Teleférico Cerro San Cristóbal', 'natural_attraction', 'cablecar', 'Santiago', 'Chile', 'https://www.google.com/maps/search/?api=1&query=Telef%C3%A9rico%20Cerro%20San%20Crist%C3%B3bal%20Av.%20El%20Cerro%20750%2C%207500000%20Providencia%2C%20Regi%C3%B3n%20Metropolitana%2C%20Chile', 'https://citymapper.com/directions?endcoord=-33.4146797,-70.6155955&endname=Telef%C3%A9rico%20Cerro%20San%20Crist%C3%B3bal', '{\"plus_code\":{\"global_code\":\"47RFH9PM+4Q\",\"compound_code\":\"H9PM+4Q Providencia, Chile\"},\"geometry\":{\"viewport\":{\"northeast\":{\"lat\":-33.41339361970851,\"lng\":-70.6146541697085},\"southwest\":{\"lat\":-33.41609158029151,\"lng\":-70.61735213029151}},\"location_type\":\"ROOFTOP\",\"location\":{\"lat\":-33.4146797,\"lng\":-70.6155955}},\"address_components\":[{\"long_name\":\"750\",\"types\":[\"street_number\"],\"short_name\":\"750\"},{\"types\":[\"route\"],\"long_name\":\"Avenida El Cerro\",\"short_name\":\"Av.

Subsequently, on June 7, 2009, another mechanical failure occurred in the system: the gearbox that regulated the speed of the system exploded, which caused the indefinite suspension of the service.\\n\\n## Second era (2016-present) =In 2011 a project was presented to tender the cable car, provide it with new cabins and restore the infrastructure. It was expected that in 2012 the service reopened the public, nevertheless the Ministry of Housing and Urban Development received only one offer which it rejected, reason why it declared deserted the licitation and announced a new public contest, that began in November 2013.\\nIn December 2014, it was announced that the cable car would be reopened in the second half of 2016, following a series of maintenance and remodeling works that began in March 2015 and will cost 9.5 million dollars. These works included the installation of the new network of 47 cabins with capacity for six people each.\\n\\nIn January 2016, the Chilean Ministry of Housing and Urban Development launched a public competition for social and non-governmental organizations, neighborhood or municipal councils to submit projects to recover assets of the 56 cabins that were discontinued and which were part of the original system in 1980. On July 29 of the same year the winning projects, which included libraries, recreational spaces, and a motorized train in Pueblito Las Vizcachas were presented at the Espacio Matta Cultural Center.\\nThe cable car was reopened on November 24, 2016, by President Michelle Bachelet. Between December 14 and 16, the cable car closed temporarily due to its first maintenance operation after reaching 500 operating hours and receiving more than 68 thousand visits in 16 days.\\n\\n\\n## Characteristics \\nThe new cable car has 47 cabins (16 red, 16 blue and 15 green) that can carry up to 6 people each, plus 8 cars designed exclusively to carry bicycles (four in each cart) and a maintenance trolley. Its speed varies between 1 and 5 meters per second (18 km/h).\\nThe system has three stations: Oasis, Tupahue and Cumbre. In the latter it connects with the Funicular de Santiago. The Tupahue is located near the Tupahue Pool, the Mapulemu Botanical Garden (\"Forest of the Earth\") and the Camino Real Restaurant.\\n', 'dSop1JRmi76I', 'https://img.icons8.com/?size=150&id=dSop1JRmi76I', '', '#e8ffe9', '#8b998b'], ['Providência', 'site', 'neighbourhood', 'Santiago', 'Chile', 'https://www.google.com/maps/search/?api=1&query=Provid%C3%AAncia%20Providencia%2C%20Santiago%20Metropolitan%20Region%2C%20Chile', 'https://citymapper.com/directions?endcoord=-33.4314428,-70.609455&endname=Provid%C3%AAncia', '{\"place_id\":\"ChIJ92aDbnzPYpYRfI1HCsD874c\",\"types\":[\"locality\",\"political\"],\"formatted_address\":\"Providencia, Santiago Metropolitan Region, Chile\",\"address_components\":[{\"long_name\":\"Providencia\",\"types\":[\"locality\",\"political\"],\"short_name\":\"Providencia\"},{\"long_name\":\"Providencia\",\"short_name\":\"Providencia\",\"types\":[\"administrative_area_level_3\",\"political\"]},{\"types\":[\"administrative_area_level_2\",\"political\"],\"short_name\":\"Santiago Province\",\"long_name\":\"Santiago Province\"},{\"types\":[\"administrative_area_level_1\",\"political\"],\"long_name\":\"Santiago Metropolitan Region\",\"short_name\":\"Santiago Metropolitan Region\"},{\"types\":[\"country\",\"political\"],\"short_name\":\"CL\",\"long_name\":\"Chile\"}],\"geometry\":{\"location_type\":\"APPROXIMATE\",\"location\":{\"lat\":-33.4314428,\"lng\":-70.609455},\"viewport\":{\"northeast\":{\"lat\":-33.403412,\"lng\":-70.58225019999999},\"southwest\":{\"lat\":-33.4498411,\"lng\":-70.63624949999999}},\"bounds\":{\"northeast\":{\"lat\":-33.403412,\"lng\":-70.58225019999999},\"southwest\":{\"lng\":-70.63624949999999,\"lat\":-33.4498411}}}}', '-33.4314428', '-70.609455', '', '', 'Providencia, Santiago Metropolitan Region, Chile', 'APPROXIMATE', 'ChIJ92aDbnzPYpYRfI1HCsD874c', 'providencia  santiago chile', 'en', 'https://en.wikipedia.org/?curid=1092877', 'Providencia, Chile', '1092877', '<span class=\"searchmatch\">Providencia</span> (Spanish pronunciation: [pɾoβiˈðensja], Spanish: &quot;providence&quot;) is a commune of <span class=\"searchmatch\">Chile</span> located in <span class=\"searchmatch\">Santiago</span> City.

It was inaugurated by then-president Michelle Bachelet on January 11, 2010, as part of government\\'s commemoration of the bicentennial of Chile.\\n\\n\\n## History \\nIn her speech on May 21, 2007, before the full Congress, President Michelle Bachelet announced the construction of a memorial museum, and a month later she announced a public competition to select an architectural design for it. On August 28 of that year, it was announced that the winning project belonged to a group of Brazilian architects from the office \"Estudio America\", located in São Paulo. In 2008, a contest to determine who would be in charge of the operation of the museum; \"Árbol de Color S. A.\" was chosen.\\nThe first stone of the museum was laid on December 10, 2008, by Bachelet, who was herself a victim of torture during the dictatorship of Pinochet. The materials and documentation for the museum\\'s collection were mostly provided by the organization Casa de la Memoria, whose donations arrived on June 16, 2009, at the La Moneda Palace. Parallel to the construction of the museum, on December 3, 2009, the museum\\'s board was formed, and on January 6, 2010, Romy Schmidt was appointed as its executive director. Bachelet inaugurated the museum on January 11, 2010, two months before the end of her term.\\nThe museum houses torture devices used during the Pinochet dictatorship, letters to family members by prisoners in detention centers, newspaper clippings, and testimony from survivors.  The museum also includes a philosophical examination of human rights. Chilean popular icon and folksinger Víctor Jara\\'s last poem, Estadio Chile, written shortly before his death in the stadium during the 1973 coup, sprawls across the entrance to the museum.\\nIn 2013, the Foundation Museo de la Memoria and the Inter-American Court of Human Rights signed an agreement to established a network of institutions dedicated to this theme. The agreement was to include joint conferences and seminars, as well as interchange of officials, professional practices, research and publication.\\nAccording to a 2021 study of the impact of the museum on visitors, \"Chilean university students [who visit the museum subsequently] display greater support for democratic institutions, are more likely to reject institutions associated with the repressive period, and are more supportive of restorative transitional justice policies after visiting regardless of their ideological priors. We test for the persistence of these results and find that some of the effects endure for six months following the museum visit. We find support for the notion that emotional appeals deployed in the museum can shift citizen attitudes, which might have implications for processes of reconciliation.\"\\n', 'lAwJ42xa0VsG', 'https://img.icons8.com/?size=150&id=lAwJ42xa0VsG', '', '#fffde8', '#99978b'], ['Parque Bicentenario', 'natural_attraction', 'park', 'Santiago', 'Chile', 'https://www.google.com/maps/search/?api=1&query=Parque%20Bicentenario%20Parque%20Bicentenario%20-%20Av.%20Bicentenario%203236%2C%20Vitacura%2C%20Regi%C3%B3n%20Metropolitana%2C%20Chile', 'https://citymapper.com/directions?endcoord=-33.3986278,-70.6024804&endname=Parque%20Bicentenario', '{\"address_components\":[{\"types\":[\"establishment\",\"park\",\"point_of_interest\",\"tourist_attraction\"],\"long_name\":\"Parque Bicentenario\",\"short_name\":\"Parque Bicentenario\"},{\"short_name\":\"3236\",\"long_name\":\"3236\",\"types\":[\"street_number\"]},{\"short_name\":\"Av.

Libertador Bernardo O'Higgins, in Santiago de Chile. The complex was originally built to serve as the headquarters for the third UNCTAD conference, which was held in Santiago in 1972, and consisted of a convention center and an adjoining 22-stories building. The building was finished in only 275 days in a significant effort supported by several thousand volunteers. This effort was part of a major propaganda initiative performed by the socialist government of Salvador Allende, in power between the end of 1970 and September 1973 .After the conference, the building was used as a cultural center until the 1973 Chilean coup d'état. After the end of the Pinochet regime, it hosted a number of conventions and the adjacent tower became the main building for the Ministry of National Defense. In early 2006, a fire destroyed parts of the building, which led the government of Michelle Bachelet to rethink the original sense of the building and return it into a cultural center, open to the public. Adapting the structure of its urban environment, the building takes on the concept of transparency and many artworks from the original design. The second phase that contains an auditorium with space for more than 2000 is going to start soon.\\nThe Centro Cultural Gabriela Mistral was inaugurated in September 2010 and is named after Chilean poet-diplomat, educator and humanist Gabriela Mistral.  Today it's a cultural centre devoted to disseminate and promote performing arts and music. Among many other activities, it offers contemporary drama and dance, as well as classic and popular music, a space to continuous development and experimentation. Furthermore, with an emphasis on contemporary photography and popular arts, the GAM houses a range for visual arts. Due to its high demands for transparency, variety and quality, it is orientated to generate direct encounters between artists and diverse audiences.\\n\", 'lAwJ42xa0VsG', 'https://img.icons8.com/?size=150&id=lAwJ42xa0VsG', '', '#fffde8', '#99978b'], ['Parque Quinta Normal', 'natural_attraction', 'park', 'Santiago', 'Chile', 'https://www.google.com/maps/search/?api=1&query=Parque%20Quinta%20Normal%20Parque%20Quinta%20Normal%2C%20Puente%20Alto%2C%20Regi%C3%B3n%20Metropolitana%2C%20Chile', 'https://citymapper.com/directions?endcoord=-33.5727782,-70.5726858&endname=Parque%20Quinta%20Normal', '{\"place_id\":\"ChIJQTAe7dfWYpYRAO6XXHef45M\",\"types\":[\"route\"],\"address_components\":[{\"short_name\":\"Parque Quinta Normal\",\"long_name\":\"Parque Quinta Normal\",\"types\":[\"route\"]},{\"long_name\":\"Puente Alto\",\"types\":[\"locality\",\"political\"],\"short_name\":\"Puente Alto\"},{\"types\":[\"administrative_area_level_3\",\"political\"],\"short_name\":\"Puente Alto\",\"long_name\":\"Puente Alto\"},{\"long_name\":\"Cordillera\",\"short_name\":\"Cordillera\",\"types\":[\"administrative_area_level_2\",\"political\"]},{\"long_name\":\"Región Metropolitana\",\"types\":[\"administrative_area_level_1\",\"political\"],\"short_name\":\"Región Metropolitana\"},{\"types\":[\"country\",\"political\"],\"long_name\":\"Chile\",\"short_name\":\"CL\"}],\"formatted_address\":\"Parque Quinta Normal, Puente Alto, Región Metropolitana, Chile\",\"geometry\":{\"location_type\":\"GEOMETRIC_CENTER\",\"bounds\":{\"northeast\":{\"lat\":-33.5722151,\"lng\":-70.5726478},\"southwest\":{\"lng\":-70.5727873,\"lat\":-33.5727797}},\"viewport\":{\"southwest\":{\"lat\":-33.5738463802915,\"lng\":-70.57406653029152},\"northeast\":{\"lat\":-33.57114841970851,\"lng\":-70.5713685697085}},\"location\":{\"lat\":-33.5727782,\"lng\":-70.5726858}}}', '-33.5727782', '-70.5726858', 'Parque Quinta Normal', 'Parque Quinta Normal', 'Parque Quinta Normal, Puente Alto, Región Metropolitana, Chile', 'GEOMETRIC_CENTER', 'ChIJQTAe7dfWYpYRAO6XXHef45M', 'Quinta Normal Park', 'en', 'https://en.wikipedia.org/?curid=35985514', 'Quinta Normal Park', '35985514', '<span class=\"searchmatch\">Quinta</span> <span class=\"searchmatch\">Normal</span> <span class=\"searchmatch\">Park</span> is an urban <span class=\"searchmatch\">park</span> in the city of Santiago, Chile.

Falabella shopping malls subsidiary. It is headquartered in Santiago. The company manages shopping malls in Chile, Peru and Colombia. It has 24 shopping malls with a total of GLA 672,700 square meters.\\n\\n\\n## Company history The powerful Said clan in South America was founded by patriarch Isa Said, who immigrated to Peru from Jerusalem and made a fortune in commerce. His five sons contributed much towards the development of the textile industry in Peru and Bolivia, managing extensive cotton plantations and cotton-yarn factories. One of the five was Salvador, the father of nine children, including one son named José Said Saffie. José became involved in his extended family\\'s operations at an early age. During the 1940s, the Said family relocated to Chile to develop a textile industry there, and José Said was an active participant in their first business, Industrias Químicas Generales. In the 1960s, José Said and his uncle founded Banco del Trabajo, which grew to be among the five largest banks in Chile.\\n\\n## Chilean projects during the 1980s =In 1979, José Said founded Parque Arauco S.A. (PASA), a real estate development firm that was incorporated in 1981. The following year, he and his associates, who included Tomás Fürst Freiwirth and the Martínez Perales brothers, opened the Parque Arauco Shopping Center in the Las Condes municipality of Santiago, which contained retail stores Gala-Sears and Muricy (later owned by Falabella and Almacenes París, respectively). Since the mall adjoins at Kennedy Avenue (Avenida Kennedy), it is often referred to as Parque Arauco Kennedy to distinguish it from the corporation. Aided by an overvalued Chilean peso and an economic free trade policy, Chile was saturated with inexpensive foreign products when Parque Arauco Kennedy was inaugurated, and those who could afford to buy filled the new mall. However, the Chilean economy was falling into deep recession. Around the same time, the company introduced Arauco Outlet Mall in Santiago\\'s Maipú municipality. This commercial center did not perform well and was later converted into a shopping mall.\\n\\n## 1990s =In 1997, PASA\\'s partners decided to divide their Chilean holdings. The Said group acquired Fürst\\'s 12% holding and turned over to Fürst its 14% share of Plaza Vespucio, which became the core property of Fürst\\'s rival venture, Grupo Plaza (or Mall Plaza). The Said group now controlled 38% of PASA\\'s outstanding shares. The Abumohor family, also active in textiles and, like the Saids, of Arab origin, held 10%. Two pension funds held a combined 24%. Parque Arauco Kennedy was Chile\\'s largest shopping mall at the time, with annual sales of $500 million, while Plaza Vespucio ranked third, at $380 million. A medical tower was being constructed at Parque Arauco Kennedy, and an office building was being contemplated at a cost of $100 million. For Mall Arauco Maipú, PASA was considering building an additional medical tower and a high-rise apartment building. In 1999, PASA, in partnership with the Almacenes Paris and Ripley retail chain, completed the Marina Arauco Mall in Viña del Mar at a cost of $120 million. PASA malls accounted for 24% of Chile\\'s shopping-center revenues in that year.\\n\\n\\n## Entry into Argentina PASA entered Argentina in the early 1990s, when the nation was emerging from a decade of economic crisis. In 1992, the company acquired a 25% share of the Centro Comercial Mendoza Plaza Shopping and later became a major investor in Argentine real estate in association with Inversiones y Representaciones S.A. (IRSA). In 1994, IRSA and PASA became partners in Sociedad Anónimo del Mercado de Abasto Provedor (Samap), a joint venture to convert the former produce market in Buenos Aires to a shopping mall. PASA donated its share of the Mendoza shopping center to Samap, while IRSA turned over its holding in Nuevo Noa Shopping, located in Salta City. In 1997, after Samap was renamed Alto Palermo S.A. (APSA), IRSA controlled 51%, while Parque Arauco controlled 35%.\\nIn 1997, Samap acquired Alto Palermo S.A. from the Pérez Company S.A. holding company. APSA held three Buenos Aires shopping centers: Alto Palermo, Alto Avellaneda, and Paseo Alcorta, plus 50.5% of a fourth, Buenos Aires Design. Abasto Shopping Center was completed in 1998 at a cost of about $112 million. Located in Balvanera, a formerly Jewish barrio that was also the stamping grounds of Carlos Gardel, Argentina\\'s well-known tango dancer and singer, it occupied five levels, with 189 stores, a food court, a multiplex cinema, entertainment facilities, and a children\\'s museum.\\n\\n## Argentine recession =The 1998–2002 Argentine great depression culminated in the government defaulting on its debt and the devaluation of the Argentine peso at the end of 2001. APSA\\'s market value declined from $390 million to as low as $40 million. The damage to PASA\\'s finances inspired a shakeup of the company\\'s management. In an interview with the new general manager, Andrés Olivos, for the Chilean magazine La Capital in 2003, reporter Lorena Medel contended that \"it was rumored that Parque Arauco had had a grade-10 earthquake. That its finances were delicate, and that shareholders couldn\\'t believe the level of debt that was permitted to arise with respect to Arauco Salud\" (the medical tower). Olivos denied the situation was ever as dire as some suspected and revealed that the company was opening a \"gastronomical boulevard\" for Parque Arauco Kennedy. He conceded that Arauco Maipú had failed as an outlet store center and had returned to its role as a traditional mall.\\nOlivos acknowledged that PASA had fallen behind Grupo Plaza and Cencosud S.A. in commercial real estate development in Chile. \"Our strategy\", he maintained, \"is distinct, and we believe that to enter this headlong race by adding square meters doesn\\'t necessarily add value. A good part of this growth only generates cannibalization, and many of the new investments won\\'t pay off in any foreseeable amount of time.\" Olivos said that PASA maintained a 32% market share in Santiago, with annual sales of roughly $200 million, and 20 million annual customers for Arauco Kennedy, 15 million for Arauco Maipú, and 17 million for Marina Arauco. He added that the company had 45% of the mall market in Buenos Aires. Olivos revealed that PASA signed a contract with Arauco Salud\\'s new owners that would permit it to recover the $2.5 million debt incurred while constructing the 13-story tower. The company was also contemplating construction of a dental-office building in Arauco Kennedy. In addition, PASA completed its gastronomical boulevard during late 2003.\\n\\n## After the revival of the Argentine economy =With the revival of the Argentine economy well underway, PASA was planning new shopping malls in Rosario, Neuquén, and Caballito, the latter two in collaboration with IRSA by means of APSA. Alto Rosario Shopping, completed in late 2004 in partnership with Coto Centro Integral de Comercialización S.A., was a conversion of an old railroad station within the original structure. APSA also had plans to enter Córdoba by purchasing land or acquiring one of three existing shopping centers. Sales from PASA properties were expected to reach $1.1 billion in 2004, with Argentina providing 38% of the total. All of APSA\\'s properties were at least 96% leased. PASA\\'s debt in Argentina was reduced from over $200 million in 2002 to about $28 million in 2003.\\n\\n\\n## Developments since 2005 In a 2005 article, La Capital proclaimed that PASA had \"woken up\", with its three Chilean malls fully occupied, the success of Boulevard Gastronómico, a strong financial structure, many new projects for the next two years, and intentions to enter the retail market. The company was planning to construct 40 new Boulevard sites, a $20 million office real-estate project, remodel Arauco Maipú, build, in alliance with the Almacenes Paris and Ripley, a new commercial center in Curicó, and possibly financing retail businesses. He told the magazine, however, that the shopping mall market was saturated in Santiago and that PASA was not interested in entering \"the war for square meters.\" Indeed, he voiced his belief that only three or four malls in Chile generated enough business to justify the level of investment that had been made in them. In Argentina, besides participating in the construction of Alto Rosario, PASA was preparing to increase its stake in APSA from 27% to 32% with the impending conversion of $200 million in convertible bonds to common stock. In 2004, PASA reported net profits of CLP 7.56 billion on revenues of CLP 24.89 billion. The company\\'s long-term debt was CLP 101.92 billion at the end of 2004.\\n\\n\\n## Notes ==', 'GkX1pWi41B1h', 'https://img.icons8.com/?size=150&id=GkX1pWi41B1h', '', '#ffe8e8', '#998b8b'], ['Costanera Mall', 'market', 'shopping', 'Santiago', 'Chile', 'https://www.google.com/maps/search/?api=1&query=Costanera%20Mall%20Av.%20Andr%C3%A9s%20Bello%202425%2C%207510689%20Providencia%2C%20Regi%C3%B3n%20Metropolitana%2C%20Chile', 'https://citymapper.com/directions?endcoord=-33.4177448,-70.6065351&endname=Costanera%20Mall', '{\"address_components\":[{\"types\":[\"street_number\"],\"short_name\":\"2425\",\"long_name\":\"2425\"},{\"types\":[\"route\"],\"short_name\":\"Av.

One of the other buildings in the complex is 170 metres (560 ft) high, while the other is only four stories.\\nConstruction of the Costanera Center was temporarily halted in January 2009 due to the late 2000s recession.

The main locality is San José de Maipo, the capital of the commune that includes all of the Andean sector of the Metropolitan Region. The valley ends close to Pirque and begins almost at the border with Argentina, where it is surrounded by some of the highest peaks in the region, including San José, Maipo, and Marmolejo, the most southerly mountain taller than 6,000 metres (20,000 ft) in the world. Several of the mountains are active volcanoes; San Jose was the most recent to erupt, in 1960.\\nThe canyon is a popular tourist destination for hikers and campers.

One of the biggest among these projects is the construction of two buildings named Valle de los Condores. The last year also sees the installation of additional chairlifts and a ski lift, and the opening of several new slopes.\\nValle Nevado Ski Resort opened the first mountain cable car in Chile in 2013.\\n\\n\\n## Description The season traditionally starts in June and ends in October. The ski resort has 34 marked slopes, 4 for beginners, 11 for intermediates, 14 for advanced levels and 5 for experts. Access to the slopes is done through 16 mechanical means installed on the mountain. There is also a snow park for practicing more radical maneuvers.\\n\\n\\n## Services Valle Nevado has a ski and snowboard school, equipment rental service, medical center, mini-market and several stores. There is also a wide variety of restaurants and hotels close to the slopes.\\n\\n\\n## Geography \\n## Climate =Due to its elevation, Valle Nevado has an alpine climate (Dfc, according to the Köppen climate classification, bordering on Dfb and ET), with drier summers and humid winters, with an average annual precipitation of 1,042 mm (41 in).

The club\\'s nickname is \"Ruleteros\" or the roulette players in English, after Viña del Mar\\'s status as a gambling resort.\\nEverton is Chile\\'s sixth most successful team, having won the national title 4 times, an achievement shared with both Audax Italiano and Magallanes. Additionally, it is the second most successful team outside Santiago de Chile, behind Cobreloa of Calama.\\nThe club\\'s home stadium is the 22,340 capacity Estadio Sausalito, while its biggest rival is Santiago Wanderers of Valparaíso. In the meetings between the two clubs, Everton have won 65 to 49 losses.\\n\\n\\n## History \\n## Foundation and Amateur Era =On 24 June 1909, a group of immigrants from England, led by David Foxley, founded Everton Football Club in Cerro Alegre of Valparaíso. The choice of this name is still to this day a mystery, although there are various competing theories. The most accepted theory is that this was chosen in honour of the namesake club in the city of Liverpool, which was, by then, touring Argentina. Another theory states the name of a toffee at the time. The first president was Francisco Boundy, while David Foxley was appointed honorary chairman. In 1950 the club was renamed Everton de Viña del Mar.\\nThe first match played was against Graphie FC with the starting lineup composed of Arturo Foxley as the goalkeeper, Percy Holmes and Francisco Boundy as the defenders; Alberto González, Hugo Boundy and Carlos González as the midfielders and finally J. Escobar, A. Aravena, David Foxley, V. Estay and Malcolm Fraser as the strikers.\\nOriginally the club was a compendium of different sports, the most important being track and field, human swimming, badminton, rugby, gymnastics, basketball and football.\\nEverton\\'s first championship participation was the 1912 amateur championship of the Liga de Valparaíso.\\n\\n## The Golden age Everton\\'s first championship win was in 1950 under the Argentine coach Martín García. They defeated Unión Española 1–0 away in a play-off on 14 January 1951. The lone goal was scored by René Meléndez in the Estadio Nacional de Chile before 45,000 spectators.\\nIn 1951, Everton finished the league in fourth, 5 points behind Audax Italiano. The following year, Everton clinched the Primera División with two weeks to spare, as Martín García\\'s side beat Audax Italiano 4–0 at home win. In the championship-winning squad the most prominent players were José María Lourido, Elías Cid and René Meléndez, top-scorer of the tournament with 30 goals. During this period the club also won against important clubs of South America, the most recorded match was against the Argentine club Independiente of Avellaneda, in a 5–0 home win at Estadio El Tranque with 12,000 spectators.\\nThe performance of the club began to decline, and apart from a third-place finish in 1955, Everton\\'s highest finish for the remainder of the 1950s would be sixth position in the 12-team league.\\n\\n## 1970-present =After many years of revolving between the Primera División and the 2nd tier the club finally clinched their third Primera División championship in the 1976 Primera División under the guidance of manager Pedro Morales. They have won the 2nd division championship on two occasions, the first in 1974 and most recently in 2003. The club has played in 2 Copa Libertadores tournaments, the first came in 1977 after their Primera División 1976 championship.\\nIn Torneo Apertura 2007 the club ended in 12th position, but in the Torneo Clausura the club made the worst campaign in its history ended in last position (21st).\\nIn the Torneo Apertura 2008 Everton was proclaimed champion of the tournament, with a 3–2 aggregate result against Colo-Colo in Estadio Sausalito. In the first leg Everton lost 2–0 away at the Estadio Monumental David Arellano with goals by Lucas Barrios and Gonzalo Fierro but in the second home leg at the Estadio Sausalito Everton won 3–0 with two goals by Ezequiel Miralles and one from Jaime Riveros. In thanks to that tournament win in 2009 Everton qualified for the Copa Libertadotes, for the second time in their history.\\nOn 4 August 2010 at Goodison Park in Liverpool England, Everton de Viña del Mar for the first time played the club they were named in honour of, their namesakes Everton. In a friendly match for the Copa Hermandad (known in English as the Brotherhood Trophy), the match was to promote closer ties between the two Evertons. The match was won 2–0 by the original Everton with goals from Jermaine Beckford and Diniyar Bilyaletdinov. That year Everton de Viña, were relegated to Primera B.\\nTwo seasons later, Everton de Viña featured in the Primera B promotion play-off against Universidad de Concepción, winning the first (home) leg on 18 November 2012 (1–0) with a goal from Angel Rojas. In the away leg on 26 November 2012 two goals from José Luis Muñoz and one from Yonathan Suazo secured a 1–3 win and a return to the top-flight of Chilean football in 2013.\\n\\n\\n## Rivalries Everton\\'s main rivals are Santiago Wanderers, from the nearby city of Valparaíso. Valparaíso is seen as a historical city with rich culture, home of worldwide known poet Pablo Neruda, whilst Viña del Mar is renowned for being a glamorous and luxurious place full of resorts. The local derby is dubbed the \"Clásico Porteño\" or \"The Seaport Derby\" in English.\\n\\n\\n## Stadium \\nThe club\\'s home games are played at the Estadio Sausalito, which has a capacity of 22,340 seats being built in 1929. The name comes from the nearby lagoon Sausalito. The stadium was used as one of the venues for the 1962 FIFA World Cup. The stadium hosted the semi-final between Czechoslovakia and Yugoslavia. It was also one of four venues to host matches during the 1991 Copa América and 2015 Copa América.\\n\\n\\n## Honours Primera División: 4\\n1950, 1952, 1976, 2008 Apertura\\nCopa Chile: 1\\n1984\\nPrimera B: 1\\n2003\\nCopa Apertura Segunda División: 1\\n1982\\nPrimera B Clausura: 1\\n2011\\nSección Profesional de Viña del Mar: 1\\n1944\\n\\n\\n## Club facts 67 Seasons in Primera División\\n14 Seasons in Primera B\\n3 Participations in Copa Libertadores (1977, 2009, 2022)\\n3 Participations in Copa Sudamericana (2017, 2018, 2022)\\n\\n\\n## South American cups history \\n\\n## Records Record Primera División victory — 7–0 v.

It was founded during the 1930s, nestled in a small valley in the Andes mountains close to other ski areas such as Valle Nevado, La Parva, and El Colorado.\\n\\n\\n## Location \\nLocated in the commune of Lo Barnechea, 36 km from Santiago at an altitude of 2,340 meters above sea level (7,874 feet), Farellones has a health centre, a school, and about 200 houses. The houses and cabins are made of wood, giving the village its characteristic look.\\n\\n\\n## Ski resort Skiers began visiting the Farellones area in the 1930s and in 1937, landowner Von Kiesling decided to sell the land off as plots to form a village. Not long after this, Antonio Padrós opened one of Farellones’ first hotels, the Posada de Farellones.\\nFarellones currently has only a few ski runs but its cable car system provides access to El Colorado, located only five kilometres up the hill of the same name. They are often considered as one joint ski area with a total of 62 runs including 11 for beginners, 6 for intermediates, 33 for advanced skiers, and 12 for experts. They have a maximum altitude of 3,333 meters above sea level, a vertical descent of 906 metres, and an average of 5 meters of snowfall in an average year. They are popular with beginners and families.\\n\\n\\n## History of skiing in Farellones Skiing began in Farellones in the early 1930s, when ski gear came to Chile for the first time from Switzerland and Norway, consisting of wooden skis, leather boots coated in colourless grease to keep out the wet, with basic and dangerous bindings that remained fixed to the feet even during a fall.\\nThe village grew up around the new sport and in 1937, the Hotel Posada de Farellones was constructed. Some years later the hotel received a royal visit from the English Duchess of Kent and served a formal luncheon. The first ski lift was built in the 1950s in La Gran Bajada (the great descent) in the area that would become later El Colorado, where the boldest skiers could leap over the roof of the Hotel Posada de Farellones at the end of the run.\\nThe developments continued up the mountain with La Parva and finally Valle Nevado.\\n\\n\\n## Archaeology \\nLong time before the birth of Farellones village, the place was visited by arrieros (wranglers) with their livestock and adventurers searching for old Inca treasure, as it was common to find Pucarás (fortifications) and other remains of Inca settlements.\\nOn February 1, 1954, the arrieros Luis Ríos Barrueto, Guillermo Chacón Carrasco,and Jaime Ríos Abarca found the Plomo Mummy (also known as the Boy of El Plomo or La Momia del Cerro El Plomo in Spanish) on Cerro El Plomo. The mummy is a well preserved Inca girl  and was the first discovery of a frozen, high-altitude human sacrifice made by the Incas.\\n\\n## Casa de Piedra =At one side of the road to Valle Nevado is the Casa de Piedra de Farellones (Farellones Stone House), a stone structure that is believed to have been built by the Aconcagua people (late neolithic). It is thought to have been used as a temporary refuge in expeditions to gather the special kind of stone needed for making tools hunting Guanacos.\\n\\n## Inca roads Corral Quemado, 28.75 km east of Santiago and 14.5 miles from Lo Barnechea, formed part of the Inca road system. It was the road from the copper mines, today known as \"Disputada de las Condes\", to the Mapocho River. The Inca road system was the spine of the Inca state, essential to administrate and control their vast territory.\\nThe Spanish chronicles say that the Inca Road ran from the other side of the Andes, in Cuyo Province, Argentina, through Chilean valleys of Huechuraba and Colina  and continued to the valley of what is now Santiago.\\n\\n\\n## The hotel The Hotel Posada de Farellones is made from a mix of wood and stone in the Swiss style and was built in the late 1930s by Antonio Padrós.  Its location allowed easy access to the three main ski resorts in Chile, which together form the biggest ski area of South America and the southern hemisphere: La Parva, El Colorado-Farellones and Valle Nevado.\\n\\n\\n## Access There is only one road giving access to the village through the winding canyons of the Mapocho River, Molina River and Estero Yerba Loca river. From Corral Quemado onwards, the road has more than 40 hairpin turns and requires a vehicle equipped with snow chains in snowy conditions. The road only permits ascent between the hours of 8:30 and 13:30 and descent from 15:30 to 20:00 during peak ski season days.\\n\\n## New road =A new road was scheduled to be built in 2014. The road would run for 29 kilometers from Las Condes Avenue in Santiago, and would also see the construction of new real estate and a cable cart from Yerba Loca Nature Sanctuary to Farellones village.\\n\\n\\n## Yerba Loca Nature Sanctuary Yerba Loca Nature Sanctuary (Spanish: \"Santuario Natural Yerba Loca\") is a protected area that extends from the top of La Paloma Hill (Spanish: \"Cerro La Paloma\") to the top of Cerro El Plomo, dividing the valleys of the Blanco River and Olivares River.\\nThe area contains temperate coniferous forest, picnic and camping facilities, and the starting point for five trails, one of which ends at the hanging glaciers of Cerro La Paloma and Cerro El Altar.\\n\\n\\n## Incident On July 14, 2016, Matilda Rapaport, a Swedish professional extreme skier, was buried in an avalanche. She died on July 18, 2016, in a hospital in Santiago after suffering oxygen deprivation and brain damage.\\n', 'GOJ9vneGe3dU', 'https://img.icons8.com/?size=150&id=GOJ9vneGe3dU', '', '#e8ffe9', '#8b998b'], ['Ascensor Artilleria', 'tour', 'funicular', 'Valparaiso', 'Chile', 'https://www.google.com/maps/search/?api=1&query=Ascensor%20Artilleria%20Artiller%C3%ADa%2C%20Valpara%C3%ADso%2C%20Chile', 'https://citymapper.com/directions?endcoord=-33.0332511,-71.6306301&endname=Ascensor%20Artilleria', '{\"types\":[\"route\"],\"place_id\":\"ChIJm-caXtLmiZYRipEPjkXAJl4\",\"formatted_address\":\"Artillería, Valparaíso, Chile\",\"geometry\":{\"location_type\":\"GEOMETRIC_CENTER\",\"viewport\":{\"northeast\":{\"lng\":-71.62945981970849,\"lat\":-33.0318731197085},\"southwest\":{\"lat\":-33.03457108029149,\"lng\":-71.6321577802915}},\"bounds\":{\"northeast\":{\"lat\":-33.0324297,\"lng\":-71.6298817},\"southwest\":{\"lng\":-71.6317359,\"lat\":-33.0340145}},\"location\":{\"lat\":-33.0332511,\"lng\":-71.6306301}},\"address_components\":[{\"long_name\":\"Artillería\",\"types\":[\"route\"],\"short_name\":\"Artillería\"},{\"long_name\":\"Valparaíso\",\"types\":[\"locality\",\"political\"],\"short_name\":\"Valparaíso\"},{\"types\":[\"administrative_area_level_3\",\"political\"],\"short_name\":\"Valparaíso\",\"long_name\":\"Valparaíso\"},{\"types\":[\"administrative_area_level_2\",\"political\"],\"long_name\":\"Valparaiso\",\"short_name\":\"Valparaiso\"},{\"long_name\":\"Valparaíso\",\"types\":[\"administrative_area_level_1\",\"political\"],\"short_name\":\"Valparaíso\"},{\"short_name\":\"CL\",\"long_name\":\"Chile\",\"types\":[\"country\",\"political\"]}]}', '-33.0332511', '-71.6306301', 'Artillería', 'Artillería', 'Artillería, Valparaíso, Chile', 'GEOMETRIC_CENTER', 'ChIJm-caXtLmiZYRipEPjkXAJl4', 'ascensor artilleria valparaiso chile', 'en', 'https://en.wikipedia.org/?curid=70566', 'Valparaíso', '70566', '<span class=\"searchmatch\">Valparaíso</span> (Spanish: [balpaɾaˈiso]) is a major city, commune, seaport and naval base facility in <span class=\"searchmatch\">Valparaíso</span> Region, <span class=\"searchmatch\">Chile</span>.

Valparaíso was named originally for Valparaíso de Arriba, in Castile-La Mancha, Spain. It is located about 120 km (75 mi) northwest of Santiago, by road, and is one of the Pacific Ocean\\'s most important seaports. Valparaíso is the capital of Chile\\'s second most-populated administrative region and has been the  Chilean Navy headquarters since 1817, as well as being the seat of the Chilean National Congress (since 1990). \\nValparaíso played an important geopolitical role in the second half of the 19th century when it served as a major stopover for ships traveling between the Atlantic and Pacific oceans via  the Straits of Magellan. The area experienced rapid growth during its golden age as a magnet for European immigrants, when the city was known by international sailors as \"Little San Francisco\" and \"jewel of the Pacific\". Notable acquisitions from this golden age include Latin America\\'s oldest stock exchange, the continent\\'s first volunteer fire department, Chile\\'s first public library, and the oldest Spanish language newspaper in continuous publication in the world, El Mercurio de Valparaíso. In 2003, the historic quarter of Valparaíso was declared a UNESCO World Heritage Site.\\nThe twentieth century was unfavorable to Valparaíso, as many wealthy families abandoned the city. The opening of the Panama Canal in 1914, and the associated reduction in ship traffic, dealt a serious blow to the region\\'s shipping- and port-based economy. By the 21st century, the port of San Antonio had surpassed Valparaíso in trade volume (TEU) handled, leading to the questioning of its traditional moniker of Puerto Principal (\"principal port\") of Chile. \\nBetween the years of 2000 to 2015, the city experienced a recovery, attracting artists, tourists, and cultural entrepreneurs, who settled after they were attracted by the city\\'s hillside historic districts. Today, many thousands of people visit Valparaíso each month, from Chile and abroad, to enjoy the city\\'s labyrinth of cobbled alleys and colorful buildings. The Port of Valparaíso still continues to be a major distribution center for container traffic, copper, and fruit exports. It also receives growing attention from cruise ships that visit during the South American summer. Most significantly, Valparaíso has transformed itself into a major educational and entertainment hub, with four large traditional universities, and several large vocational colleges. \\nWhile the city is well-known for its artisans and bohemian culture, it is also famous as the home of several highly-regarded music festivals and other artistic events. The largest, and arguably most iconic, is the annual Viña Del Mar International Song Festival (often simply called \"Viña\" or \"Viña Del Mar\"). Typically held in March, in a recently-refurbished, 40,000-capacity amphitheater, \"Viña\" is one of the biggest annual economic boosts to the region, as the event usually sells-out completely, and thousands of attendees and workers will travel to and stay in the city and metro area. In addition to showcasing numerous performers of many styles, and awarding various prizes, the internationally-televised and live-streamed festival is typically headlined by superstar musicians, from both the Spanish- and English-speaking worlds.\\n\\n\\n## History \\nSome older works starting with Benjamín Vicuña Mackenna (1869) claim that Valparaíso was within the range of the Chango people, but clear evidence for this is lacking.\\nThe Bay of Valparaíso\\'s first ethnically identifiable population were Picunche natives, known for their agriculture. Spanish explorers, considered the first European discoverers of Chile, arrived in 1536, aboard the Santiaguillo, a supply ship sent by Diego de Almagro. The Santiaguillo carried men and supplies for Almagro\\'s expedition, under the command of Juan de Saavedra, who named the town after his native village of Valparaíso de Arriba in Cuenca Province, Spain.\\n\\nDuring Spanish colonial times, Valparaíso remained a small village, with only a few houses and a church. On some occasions she was attacked by English pirates and privateers, such as Francis Drake with his ship Golden Hind in 1578 and later his cousin Richard Hawkins with his ship Dainty in 1594. Drake\\'s sack of Valparaíso gave origin to the legend about Cueva del Pirata.\\n\\nIn 1810, a wealthy merchant built the first pier in the history of Chile and the first during the colonial era. In its place today, stands the building of El Mercurio de Valparaíso. The ocean then rose to this point. Reclamation of land from the sea moved the coastline five blocks away. Between 1810 and 1830, he built much of the existing port of the city, including much of the land reclamation work that now comprises the city\\'s commercial centre. \\nIn 1814, the naval Battle of Valparaíso was fought offshore of the town, between American and British ships involved in the War of 1812. After Chile\\'s independence from Spain (1818), beginning the Republican Era, Valparaíso became the main harbour for the nascent Chilean navy, and opened international trade opportunities that had been formerly limited to Spain and its other colonies.\\n\\nValparaíso soon became a desired stopover for ships rounding South America via the Straits of Magellan and Cape Horn. It gained particular importance supporting and supplying the California Gold Rush (1848–1858). As a major seaport, Valparaíso received immigrants from many European countries, mainly from Britain, Germany, France, Switzerland and Italy. German, French, Italian and English were commonly spoken among its citizens, who founded and published newspapers in these languages.\\nValparaíso found maritime competition with Callao (Perú). Both cities sought to be the dominant port on the Pacific Coast of South America during the period of time known as the High Trade (1880–1930). \\nThe British community, La Colonia Britanica, prospered in Valparaíso between the 1820s and 1920s. Firms such as Antony Gibbs & Sons, Duncan Fox, and Williamson-Balfour Company were doing business in the town, which had become a significant trading center by 1840, with 166 British ships, out of a total of 287, anchored in its port. The British settled on Cerro Alegre (Mount Pleasant) and Cerro Concepción. The Association of Voluntary Firemen was created in 1851, a telegraph service to Santiago was operating by 1852, and Chile\\'s first telephone service was set up in 1880. The British Hospital was founded in 1897, and the British Arch, Arco Británico, was erected in 1911. However, by 1895, Italian immigrants exceeded the British, and both the Italians and Germans were in larger numbers by 1907. By 1920, both the Italians and Spanish outnumbered the British, and the primary British community within Chile resided in Santiago. \\n\\nInternational immigration transformed the local culture from Spanish origins and Amerindian origins, in ways that included the construction of the first non-Catholic cemetery of Chile, the Dissidents\\' Cemetery. Football (soccer) was introduced to Chile by English immigrants; and the first private Catholic school in Chile, Le Collège des Sacrés Cœurs (\"Sacred Hearts College\") and its accompanying Sacred Hearts Church, by French immigrants. Immigrants from Scotland and Germany founded the first private secular schools (The Mackay School and Die Deutsche Schule, respectively). Immigrants formed the first volunteer fire-fighting units (still a volunteer activity in Chile). Their buildings reflected a variety of European styles, making Valparaíso more varied than some other Chilean cities.\\nOn 18 August 1906, a major earthquake struck Valparaíso; there was extensive property damage and thousands of deaths. The Chilean doctor, Carlos Van Buren, of U.S. descent, was involved in the medical care of earthquake victims. He later established the Hospital  Carlos Van Buren in 1912.\\nThe golden age of Valparaíso\\'s commerce ended after the opening of the Panama Canal in 1914. Shipping shifted to the canal as captains sought to avoid the risks of the Strait of Magellan. The port\\'s use and traffic declined significantly, causing a decline in the city\\'s economy. The opening of the Panama Canal was one of the most critical events in the shaping of Valparaío\\'s economy. Since the turn of the 21st century, shipping has increased in the last few decades with fruit exports, opening the Chilean economy to world commerce, and larger-scale, Post-Panamax ships that do not fit the Panama Canal.\\n\\n## 19th century On 28 March 1814, the USS Essex was defeated by British frigates Phoebe and Cherub during the War of 1812, leading to the deaths of 58 US Marines. Captain David Porter, a survivor of this attack, would retire to Portersville, Indiana, and request changing the name to Valparaiso, commemorating the only naval battle he ever lost. By 2 August 1820, the Liberating Expedition of Peru sailed from Valparaíso.\\nAt 10:30 pm on the evening of 19 November 1822, Valparaíso experienced a violent earthquake that left the city in ruins; of the 16,000 residents, casualties included at least 66 adults and 12 children, as well as 110 people wounded. The next day, a meteor trail was visible from Quillota to Valparaíso, seen as a religious experience for much of the population.\\nIn 1826, the Royal Navy Great Britain established a South America Station in Valparaíso to maintain British naval interest in the region. It would remain until 1837, when it was relocated to Esquimalt, British Columbia. 12 September 1827 saw the establishment of El Mercurio de Valparaíso, the oldest circulating newspaper in the Spanish language worldwide.\\nIn May 1828, a constitutional convention began regular meetings in the church of San Francisco. By August 9, the Constitution of the Republic of Chile was fully drafted and disseminated.\\nOn 6 June 1837, Minister Diego Portales was shot at the port outside of Baron Hill on suspicion of promoting conspirators who opposed the Peru-Bolivian Confederation, considered a turning point of Chilean public opinion and the purpose of the war.\\nBy 1851, the first fire brigade in the country was formed. The next year potable running water became available, as well as the first telegraph service in Latin America, between the city and Santiago. It would be another four years before streetlights, with 700 gas lanterns, were installed. In 1861 the first tram company was formed, mostly using horses or mules to draw them, and fully established over the next few years.\\nIn 1852, British shipping company Williamson, Balfour & Cía was established in Valparaíso to handle trade in the region. \\nTaking advantage of the total lack of defenses, a Spanish fleet commanded by Casto Méndez Núñez bombarded the city during the Chincha Islands War in 1866. Chilean merchant ships were sunk, except for those vessels whose captains hoisted foreign flags.\\nA merger of the National Steamship Company and Chilean Steamship Company, the South American Steamship Company was created as a national response to the increasing dominance of the Pacific Steam Navigation Company in 1872. In 1880 the Chilean Telephone Company was formed by Americans Joseph Husbands, Peter MacKellar, James Martin, and the US consul Lucius Foot, the first official telephone company in the country. Three years later on the first of December, Concepción funicular opened, the first of many hydraulic systems. After the country\\'s independence and its consequent openness to international trade, Valparaíso became an important port of call on trade routes through the Eastern Pacific. Many immigrants settled there, mostly from Europe and North America, who helped include Valparaíso and Chile in the Industrial Revolution sweeping other parts of the world. This created a different city with civil, financial, commercial and industrial institutions, many of which still exist today.\\nAll this resulted in a population increases. The city reached more than 160,000 inhabitants in the late nineteenth century, making it necessary to use the steep hills for more houses, mansions and even cemeteries. The lack of available land caused the city authorities and developers to reclaim low lying tidal marshland (polders) upon which to build administrative, commercial and industrial infrastructure.\\n\\n## 20th century The twentieth century began with the first big protest of dockworkers, Chile on 15 April 1903, due to complaints by dockers about their excessive working hours and demands for higher wages, requests that were ignored by employers, creating a tense situation that led to serious violence on 12 May. There were protests and the burning of the CSAV offices and several people were shot and killed. All this prompted intervention by the state. This protest was important for the future of Trade Unionism in the country.\\nThat same year, electric trams were introduced.\\nThe 1906 Valparaíso earthquake caused severe damage throughout the city on 16 August, which was at that time the heart of the Chilean economy. The damage was valued at hundreds of millions of pesos of the time, and human victims were counted at 3,000 dead and over 20,000 injured. After the removal of the debris, reconstruction work began. This included the widening of streets, culverting and covering streams, (Jaime and Delicias – creating the avenues Francia and Argentina respectively).

Valparaíso, like most of Chile, is vulnerable to earthquakes. Before the earthquake of February 27, 2010, which measured 8.8 on the moment magnitude scale, the last catastrophic earthquake to strike Valparaíso devastated the city in August 1906, killing nearly 3,000 people. Other significant earthquakes to affect the city were the 1730 Valparaíso earthquake and the 1985 Algarrobo earthquake.\\n\\n## Geology =Because of Valparaíso\\'s proximity to the Peru–Chile Trench, the city is vulnerable to earthquakes. The Peru–Chile Trench stores large amounts of energy for a very long time and sometimes ruptures after short intervals in a violent earthquake.\\n\\n## Climate =Valparaíso has a very mild Mediterranean climate (Köppen Csb). The summer is essentially dry, but the city is affected by fogs from the Humboldt Current during most of the year. In the winter, rainfall can occasionally be extremely heavy when a powerful frontal system crosses central Chile, but frequency of such rains varies greatly from year to year. Monthly average temperatures vary just around 6°C between the coolest and the warmest month, from 17 °C (63 °F) in January to 11.4 °C (52.5 °F) in July. Snowfall occurs rarely in the highest parts of the city. In winter, strong winds can lead to wind chill temperatures below freezing.\\n\\n\\n## Cityscape \\nNicknamed \"The Jewel of the Pacific\", Valparaíso was declared a world heritage site based upon its improvised urban design and unique architecture. In 1996, the World Monuments Fund declared Valparaíso\\'s unusual system of funicular lifts (steeply inclined carriages) one of the world\\'s 100 most endangered historical treasures. In 1998, grassroots activists convinced the Chilean government and local authorities to apply for UNESCO world heritage status for Valparaíso. Valparaíso was declared a World Heritage Site in 2003. Built upon dozens of steep hillsides overlooking the Pacific Ocean, Valparaíso has a labyrinth of streets and cobblestone alleyways, embodying a rich architectural and cultural legacy. Valparaíso is protected as a UNESCO World Heritage Site.\\nSince its status as a World Heritage Site, Valparaíso has made several changes to its urban fabric in the process of maintaining its cultural heritage.\\nLandmarks include:\\n\\nIglesia de la Matriz\\nPlaza Aníbal Pinto\\nPlaza Sotomayor including the Edificio Armada de Chile\\nEdificio Luis Cousiño\\nCourthouse\\n16 remaining funiculars (called ascensores): 15 public (national monuments) and 1 private (which belongs to \"Hospital Carlos Van Buren\").\\nThe Concepcion and Alegre historical district\\nThe Bellavista hill, which has the \"Museo a Cielo Abierto\" or \"open air museum\"\\nMonument to Admiral Lord Thomas Alexander Cochrane, 10th Earl of Dundonald\\nMonument to Manuel Blanco Encalada, first Chilean President\\nCapilla del Carmen\\nCemeteries on Panteón Hill – Cemetery Number One (Catholic) and Dissidents Cemetery (Protestant)\\n=', 'dSop1JRmi76I', 'https://img.icons8.com/?size=150&id=dSop1JRmi76I', '', '#e8fffa', '#8b9996'], ['Valparaíso Chile', 'natural_attraction', 'beach', 'Valparaíso', 'Chile', 'https://www.google.com/maps/search/?api=1&query=Valpara%C3%ADso%20Chile%20Valpara%C3%ADso%2C%20Chile', 'https://citymapper.com/directions?endcoord=-33.0473128,-71.6127458&endname=Valpara%C3%ADso%20Chile', '{\"geometry\":{\"bounds\":{\"northeast\":{\"lat\":-33.0178165,\"lng\":-71.5597684},\"southwest\":{\"lng\":-71.6623287,\"lat\":-33.0825844}},\"viewport\":{\"northeast\":{\"lat\":-33.0178165,\"lng\":-71.5597684},\"southwest\":{\"lat\":-33.0825844,\"lng\":-71.6623287}},\"location_type\":\"APPROXIMATE\",\"location\":{\"lat\":-33.0473128,\"lng\":-71.6127458}},\"place_id\":\"ChIJx84g3uPdiZYRdpvhv4w6Cus\",\"types\":[\"locality\",\"political\"],\"address_components\":[{\"long_name\":\"Valparaíso\",\"types\":[\"locality\",\"political\"],\"short_name\":\"Valparaíso\"},{\"long_name\":\"Valparaíso\",\"types\":[\"administrative_area_level_3\",\"political\"],\"short_name\":\"Valparaíso\"},{\"types\":[\"administrative_area_level_2\",\"political\"],\"long_name\":\"Valparaíso Province\",\"short_name\":\"Valparaíso Province\"},{\"types\":[\"administrative_area_level_1\",\"political\"],\"long_name\":\"Valparaíso\",\"short_name\":\"Valparaíso\"},{\"long_name\":\"Chile\",\"types\":[\"country\",\"political\"],\"short_name\":\"CL\"}],\"formatted_address\":\"Valparaíso, Chile\"}', '-33.0473128', '-71.6127458', '', '', 'Valparaíso, Chile', 'APPROXIMATE', 'ChIJx84g3uPdiZYRdpvhv4w6Cus', 'valparaiso chile ', 'en', 'https://en.wikipedia.org/?curid=70566', 'Valparaíso', '70566', '<span class=\"searchmatch\">Valparaíso</span> (Spanish: [balpaɾaˈiso]) is a major city, commune, seaport and naval base facility in <span class=\"searchmatch\">Valparaíso</span> Region, <span class=\"searchmatch\">Chile</span>.

Valparaíso was named originally for Valparaíso de Arriba, in Castile-La Mancha, Spain. It is located about 120 km (75 mi) northwest of Santiago, by road, and is one of the Pacific Ocean\\'s most important seaports. Valparaíso is the capital of Chile\\'s second most-populated administrative region and has been the  Chilean Navy headquarters since 1817, as well as being the seat of the Chilean National Congress (since 1990). \\nValparaíso played an important geopolitical role in the second half of the 19th century when it served as a major stopover for ships traveling between the Atlantic and Pacific oceans via  the Straits of Magellan. The area experienced rapid growth during its golden age as a magnet for European immigrants, when the city was known by international sailors as \"Little San Francisco\" and \"jewel of the Pacific\". Notable acquisitions from this golden age include Latin America\\'s oldest stock exchange, the continent\\'s first volunteer fire department, Chile\\'s first public library, and the oldest Spanish language newspaper in continuous publication in the world, El Mercurio de Valparaíso. In 2003, the historic quarter of Valparaíso was declared a UNESCO World Heritage Site.\\nThe twentieth century was unfavorable to Valparaíso, as many wealthy families abandoned the city. The opening of the Panama Canal in 1914, and the associated reduction in ship traffic, dealt a serious blow to the region\\'s shipping- and port-based economy. By the 21st century, the port of San Antonio had surpassed Valparaíso in trade volume (TEU) handled, leading to the questioning of its traditional moniker of Puerto Principal (\"principal port\") of Chile. \\nBetween the years of 2000 to 2015, the city experienced a recovery, attracting artists, tourists, and cultural entrepreneurs, who settled after they were attracted by the city\\'s hillside historic districts. Today, many thousands of people visit Valparaíso each month, from Chile and abroad, to enjoy the city\\'s labyrinth of cobbled alleys and colorful buildings. The Port of Valparaíso still continues to be a major distribution center for container traffic, copper, and fruit exports. It also receives growing attention from cruise ships that visit during the South American summer. Most significantly, Valparaíso has transformed itself into a major educational and entertainment hub, with four large traditional universities, and several large vocational colleges. \\nWhile the city is well-known for its artisans and bohemian culture, it is also famous as the home of several highly-regarded music festivals and other artistic events. The largest, and arguably most iconic, is the annual Viña Del Mar International Song Festival (often simply called \"Viña\" or \"Viña Del Mar\"). Typically held in March, in a recently-refurbished, 40,000-capacity amphitheater, \"Viña\" is one of the biggest annual economic boosts to the region, as the event usually sells-out completely, and thousands of attendees and workers will travel to and stay in the city and metro area. In addition to showcasing numerous performers of many styles, and awarding various prizes, the internationally-televised and live-streamed festival is typically headlined by superstar musicians, from both the Spanish- and English-speaking worlds.\\n\\n\\n## History \\nSome older works starting with Benjamín Vicuña Mackenna (1869) claim that Valparaíso was within the range of the Chango people, but clear evidence for this is lacking.\\nThe Bay of Valparaíso\\'s first ethnically identifiable population were Picunche natives, known for their agriculture. Spanish explorers, considered the first European discoverers of Chile, arrived in 1536, aboard the Santiaguillo, a supply ship sent by Diego de Almagro. The Santiaguillo carried men and supplies for Almagro\\'s expedition, under the command of Juan de Saavedra, who named the town after his native village of Valparaíso de Arriba in Cuenca Province, Spain.\\n\\nDuring Spanish colonial times, Valparaíso remained a small village, with only a few houses and a church. On some occasions she was attacked by English pirates and privateers, such as Francis Drake with his ship Golden Hind in 1578 and later his cousin Richard Hawkins with his ship Dainty in 1594. Drake\\'s sack of Valparaíso gave origin to the legend about Cueva del Pirata.\\n\\nIn 1810, a wealthy merchant built the first pier in the history of Chile and the first during the colonial era. In its place today, stands the building of El Mercurio de Valparaíso. The ocean then rose to this point. Reclamation of land from the sea moved the coastline five blocks away. Between 1810 and 1830, he built much of the existing port of the city, including much of the land reclamation work that now comprises the city\\'s commercial centre. \\nIn 1814, the naval Battle of Valparaíso was fought offshore of the town, between American and British ships involved in the War of 1812. After Chile\\'s independence from Spain (1818), beginning the Republican Era, Valparaíso became the main harbour for the nascent Chilean navy, and opened international trade opportunities that had been formerly limited to Spain and its other colonies.\\n\\nValparaíso soon became a desired stopover for ships rounding South America via the Straits of Magellan and Cape Horn. It gained particular importance supporting and supplying the California Gold Rush (1848–1858). As a major seaport, Valparaíso received immigrants from many European countries, mainly from Britain, Germany, France, Switzerland and Italy. German, French, Italian and English were commonly spoken among its citizens, who founded and published newspapers in these languages.\\nValparaíso found maritime competition with Callao (Perú). Both cities sought to be the dominant port on the Pacific Coast of South America during the period of time known as the High Trade (1880–1930). \\nThe British community, La Colonia Britanica, prospered in Valparaíso between the 1820s and 1920s. Firms such as Antony Gibbs & Sons, Duncan Fox, and Williamson-Balfour Company were doing business in the town, which had become a significant trading center by 1840, with 166 British ships, out of a total of 287, anchored in its port. The British settled on Cerro Alegre (Mount Pleasant) and Cerro Concepción. The Association of Voluntary Firemen was created in 1851, a telegraph service to Santiago was operating by 1852, and Chile\\'s first telephone service was set up in 1880. The British Hospital was founded in 1897, and the British Arch, Arco Británico, was erected in 1911. However, by 1895, Italian immigrants exceeded the British, and both the Italians and Germans were in larger numbers by 1907. By 1920, both the Italians and Spanish outnumbered the British, and the primary British community within Chile resided in Santiago. \\n\\nInternational immigration transformed the local culture from Spanish origins and Amerindian origins, in ways that included the construction of the first non-Catholic cemetery of Chile, the Dissidents\\' Cemetery. Football (soccer) was introduced to Chile by English immigrants; and the first private Catholic school in Chile, Le Collège des Sacrés Cœurs (\"Sacred Hearts College\") and its accompanying Sacred Hearts Church, by French immigrants. Immigrants from Scotland and Germany founded the first private secular schools (The Mackay School and Die Deutsche Schule, respectively). Immigrants formed the first volunteer fire-fighting units (still a volunteer activity in Chile). Their buildings reflected a variety of European styles, making Valparaíso more varied than some other Chilean cities.\\nOn 18 August 1906, a major earthquake struck Valparaíso; there was extensive property damage and thousands of deaths. The Chilean doctor, Carlos Van Buren, of U.S. descent, was involved in the medical care of earthquake victims. He later established the Hospital  Carlos Van Buren in 1912.\\nThe golden age of Valparaíso\\'s commerce ended after the opening of the Panama Canal in 1914. Shipping shifted to the canal as captains sought to avoid the risks of the Strait of Magellan. The port\\'s use and traffic declined significantly, causing a decline in the city\\'s economy. The opening of the Panama Canal was one of the most critical events in the shaping of Valparaío\\'s economy. Since the turn of the 21st century, shipping has increased in the last few decades with fruit exports, opening the Chilean economy to world commerce, and larger-scale, Post-Panamax ships that do not fit the Panama Canal.\\n\\n## 19th century On 28 March 1814, the USS Essex was defeated by British frigates Phoebe and Cherub during the War of 1812, leading to the deaths of 58 US Marines. Captain David Porter, a survivor of this attack, would retire to Portersville, Indiana, and request changing the name to Valparaiso, commemorating the only naval battle he ever lost. By 2 August 1820, the Liberating Expedition of Peru sailed from Valparaíso.\\nAt 10:30 pm on the evening of 19 November 1822, Valparaíso experienced a violent earthquake that left the city in ruins; of the 16,000 residents, casualties included at least 66 adults and 12 children, as well as 110 people wounded. The next day, a meteor trail was visible from Quillota to Valparaíso, seen as a religious experience for much of the population.\\nIn 1826, the Royal Navy Great Britain established a South America Station in Valparaíso to maintain British naval interest in the region. It would remain until 1837, when it was relocated to Esquimalt, British Columbia. 12 September 1827 saw the establishment of El Mercurio de Valparaíso, the oldest circulating newspaper in the Spanish language worldwide.\\nIn May 1828, a constitutional convention began regular meetings in the church of San Francisco. By August 9, the Constitution of the Republic of Chile was fully drafted and disseminated.\\nOn 6 June 1837, Minister Diego Portales was shot at the port outside of Baron Hill on suspicion of promoting conspirators who opposed the Peru-Bolivian Confederation, considered a turning point of Chilean public opinion and the purpose of the war.\\nBy 1851, the first fire brigade in the country was formed. The next year potable running water became available, as well as the first telegraph service in Latin America, between the city and Santiago. It would be another four years before streetlights, with 700 gas lanterns, were installed. In 1861 the first tram company was formed, mostly using horses or mules to draw them, and fully established over the next few years.\\nIn 1852, British shipping company Williamson, Balfour & Cía was established in Valparaíso to handle trade in the region. \\nTaking advantage of the total lack of defenses, a Spanish fleet commanded by Casto Méndez Núñez bombarded the city during the Chincha Islands War in 1866. Chilean merchant ships were sunk, except for those vessels whose captains hoisted foreign flags.\\nA merger of the National Steamship Company and Chilean Steamship Company, the South American Steamship Company was created as a national response to the increasing dominance of the Pacific Steam Navigation Company in 1872. In 1880 the Chilean Telephone Company was formed by Americans Joseph Husbands, Peter MacKellar, James Martin, and the US consul Lucius Foot, the first official telephone company in the country. Three years later on the first of December, Concepción funicular opened, the first of many hydraulic systems. After the country\\'s independence and its consequent openness to international trade, Valparaíso became an important port of call on trade routes through the Eastern Pacific. Many immigrants settled there, mostly from Europe and North America, who helped include Valparaíso and Chile in the Industrial Revolution sweeping other parts of the world. This created a different city with civil, financial, commercial and industrial institutions, many of which still exist today.\\nAll this resulted in a population increases. The city reached more than 160,000 inhabitants in the late nineteenth century, making it necessary to use the steep hills for more houses, mansions and even cemeteries. The lack of available land caused the city authorities and developers to reclaim low lying tidal marshland (polders) upon which to build administrative, commercial and industrial infrastructure.\\n\\n## 20th century The twentieth century began with the first big protest of dockworkers, Chile on 15 April 1903, due to complaints by dockers about their excessive working hours and demands for higher wages, requests that were ignored by employers, creating a tense situation that led to serious violence on 12 May. There were protests and the burning of the CSAV offices and several people were shot and killed. All this prompted intervention by the state. This protest was important for the future of Trade Unionism in the country.\\nThat same year, electric trams were introduced.\\nThe 1906 Valparaíso earthquake caused severe damage throughout the city on 16 August, which was at that time the heart of the Chilean economy. The damage was valued at hundreds of millions of pesos of the time, and human victims were counted at 3,000 dead and over 20,000 injured. After the removal of the debris, reconstruction work began. This included the widening of streets, culverting and covering streams, (Jaime and Delicias – creating the avenues Francia and Argentina respectively). The main street of the city (Pedro Montt) was laid and Plaza O\\'Higgins was created; a hill was removed to allow the passage of Colon Street. The damaged Edwards mansion was demolished and in its place, the present Cathedral of Valparaíso was built and, among many other works, this gave shape to the Almendral Valparaíso area.\\nIn 1910, the port expansion work of the city, which ended in 1930, began. A long breakwater was built, along with piers and docking terminals.\\nThe Imperial German East Asia Squadron engaged the British West Indies Squadron on 1 November 1914 at the Battle of Coronel off the coast of Valparaiso, sinking two British cruisers. After the battle the East Asia Squadron stayed in Valparaiso Harbor before continuing to the Falklands.\\n\\n## 21st century Chile\\'s legislature along with other institutions of national importance like the National Customs Service, the National Fish and Aquaculture Ministry, the Ministry of Culture and the Barracks General of the Chilean Navy are sited in the city.

It is located at the end of Avenida Apoquindo in Los Dominicos Park, to the side of San Vicente Ferrer Church (also known as Los Dominicos Church).\\n\\n\\n## History In 1544, the lands that now hold the ‘’pueblito’’ were bestowed upon the female Spanish conquistador Inés de Suárez by the governor of Chile, Pedro de Valdivia, and from then were passed several times to different families. During the Chilean War of Independence, it was a favourite hiding place for the independence leader Manuel Rodriguez, and later the well-known Chileans Diego Barros Arana, José Manuel Balmaceda and others would occupy these lands for the same purpose.\\nFinally, the lands fell into the possession of the Cranisbro family, who were great benefactors of the Dominican order that had a monastery on one side of San Vicente Ferrer Church. The church is characterized by the copper domes that top its two towers, built in memory of the death of two Cranisbro children.

Las estatuas se erigirían en honor a la labor pública del presidente.[2]\\u200b La ley señala que un senador, un diputado, un representante del Ministro de Educación, el presidente de la Fundación Salvador Allende y el director del Museo Nacional de Bellas Artes deberán realizar un concurso público para seleccionar las obras ganadoras, determinar el sitio donde se erigirán, coordinar las actividades para la colecta de los fondos para financiar a las obras y administrar los fondos.[3]\\u200b\\nEl 24 de junio de 1994 se promulga la ley,[4]\\u200b y el mismo año se realiza el concurso público para encontrar al artista de la estatua en Santiago; Arturo Hevia, escultor de la Pontificia Universidad Católica de Chile entra al concurso.[5]\\u200b Existió un diseño inicial que finalmente fue simplificado para poder dirimir un empate técnico que existió entre dos obras finalistas. El trabajo ganador de Hevia, destaca a la figura del presidente con una bandera chilena flameando y figuras geométricas.[1]\\u200b\\nEl proyecto tuvo un coste de 120 000 USD, los cuales fueron financiados por la Fundación Salvador Allende y la Municipalidad de Santiago. La escultura demoró cerca de un año y medio para ser finalizada.[1]\\u200b La erección de la estatua se realizó en la esquina noroeste de la intersección de las calles Morandé con Moneda.[6]\\u200b\\nLa inauguración se realizó el 26 de junio de 2000,[7]\\u200b coincidente con el natalicio de Allende, y contó con la presencia del presidente de la república Ricardo Lagos, quien develó la estatua, y aproximadamente 300 invitados. El evento contó con incidentes.[8]\\u200b\\nDesde su inauguración, se realizan actividades de conmemoración del golpe de Estado del 11 de septiembre de 1973, evento donde murió Salvador Allende.[9]\\u200b[10]\\u200b El 11 de marzo de 2022, Gabriel Boric rindió honores ante la estatua antes de ingresar al Palacio de La Moneda por primera vez como presidente de Chile.[11]\\u200b[12]\\u200b\\n\\n\\n## Características técnicas La estatua se compone de tres secciones, la estatua de bronce, el pedestal de piedra y una placa descriptiva. En conjunto la escultura mide 6,5 metros.[5]\\u200b \\nLa estatua tomó cerca de un año y medio para ser finalizada. Es una escultura en bronce para la cual se utilizaron 1,5 toneladas de arcilla y 980 kilogramos de yeso para realizar el molde. Después del negativo, la fundición del bronce para el positivo tuvo un espesor de 15 milímetros, y para reforzar la estructura, se incorporaron barras de hierro de 2,54 cm de diámetro. El peso total de la escultura es de 1.480 kilogramos.[1]\\u200b La escultura representa a la figura de Salvador Allende siendo cubierto hasta la cadera con la bandera flameante de Chile.

After the project was approved by Salvador Allende himself, the Comité Internacional de Solidaridad Artística con Chile (CISAC) (International Committee of Artistic Solidarity with Chile) was formed, bringing together national and international intellectuals such as the Brazilian intellectual Mário Pedrosa and the Italian Carlo Levi.\\nAllende call to artists worldwide through an open letter, and as a result of CISAC\\'s efforts, artworks began to arrive promptly from different parts of the world between 1972 and 1973, totaling 650 artistic pieces, including paintings, prints, sculptures, drawings, tapestries, and photographs. Artists like Joan Miró, Roberto Matta, Lygia Clark, and Frank Stella sent their contributions during this period.\\nThe Museum of Solidarity was officially inaugurated on May 17, 1972, by President Allende with an exhibition at the Museum of Contemporary Art of the University of Chile.

Recoleta (oriente), La Unión (sur-oriente), Av. Profesor Zañartu (sur) y San José (occidente). El Cementerio General es administrado por la Municipalidad de Recoleta. En este cementerio yacen casi todos los directores supremos y presidentes de la República, así como la mayoría de los personajes más relevantes de la historia de Chile.[3]\\u200b\\n\\n\\n## Historia El cementerio fue inaugurado el 9 de diciembre de 1821 por Bernardo O’Higgins. La construcción del cementerio fue posible gracias a la cesión de los derechos de extracción de hielo para las heladerías. Originalmente no se podían enterrar a los protestantes, llamados entonces «disidentes», y recién en 1854 se creó el Patio de los Disidentes N.º 1. El decreto de cementerios de 1871 estableció la sepultura sin distinción de credo en un espacio debidamente separado para los disidentes y permitió la creación de cementerios laicos con fondos fiscales o municipales que debían ser administrados por el Estado o el municipio.[2]\\u200b\\nEl 2 de agosto de 1883, se promulgó la ley de cementerios civiles (como parte de las leyes laicas) bajo la presidencia de Domingo Santa María González. Estableció la administración de los cementerios públicos por el Estado o municipio y fue retirada cualquier administración eclesiástica, la no discriminación en la sepultura de los difuntos y prohibió el entierro en los terrenos de las iglesias. La autoridad eclesiástica creó el Cementerio Católico de Santiago en 1883 y lo clausuró ese mismo año. Fue reabierto en 1890.\\n\\n\\n## Arquitectura y entorno \\nSe destaca de él su riqueza en arquitectura con mausoleos de estilo egipcio, griego, mesoamericano, gótico, morisco, etc. además de esculturas, vitrales y jardines que hacen del Cementerio un patrimonio cultural de gran valor.[3]\\u200b\\nEstructuras de importancia son el Mausoleo Histórico de Chile, el Memorial del Detenido Desaparecido y del Ejecutado Político y el Memorial por la Diversidad de Chile, inaugurados en 1994.[3]\\u200b\\nAl interior del Cementerio General se encuentran ubicados el Cementerio Parque Las Encinas, y en los alrededores, el Cementerio Católico y el Cementerio Israelita de Santiago. La estación de Metro Cementerios se encuentra ubicada frente a la entrada de Avenida Recoleta.[3]\\u200b\\nCuenta con un mausoleo circense, único en el mundo, donde descansan los restos de artistas circenses chilenos desde 1942. Actualmente está diseñado bajo una gran carpa de circo luego de las remodelaciones de 2012.\\nAdemás cuenta con un Mausoleo Trans, único en Latinoamérica, iniciativa que surge por parte de Traves Chile en 2013 y se concreta en 2018, destinada a personas transgéneros.[4]\\u200b\\nEn diciembre de 2021 se inauguró el Mausoleo Memorial Dignidad, destinado a resguardar los restos de 372 personas en situación de calle, sin acompañamiento familiar o sin protección institucional, al momento de su fallecimiento. La obra fue una iniciativa de Fundación Gente de la Calle y estuvo a cargo de los arquitectos Diego Grass, Thomas Batzenschlager y José Hassi.\\n\\n\\n## Hitos y personajes ilustres En el cementerio se encuentran el Monumento de Bernardo O’Higgins y el monumento de los Detenidos Desaparecidos. Sus construcciones de variados estilos, esculturas, vitrales y amplias avenidas arboladas tienen un reconocido valor arquitectónico. \\nAl recorrer el Cementerio se puede visitar las sepulturas de algunos expresidentes como José Santiago Portales, Manuel Bulnes, José Manuel Balmaceda, Pedro Montt, Eduardo Frei Montalva, Salvador Allende y Patricio Aylwin,[5]\\u200b como también a numerosos personajes chilenos relevantes de la política, las ciencias y las artes.\\n\\n\\n## Galería de fotos \\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n## Referencias \\n\\n## Bibliografía León León, Marco Antonio. 1997.

Es conocido por su patrimonio arquitectónico y su rica historia, razones que impulsaron a la Unesco a decretar la ciudad como Patrimonio de la Humanidad.[1]\\u200b\\nEl cerro sirvió como fortaleza durante la Colonia y comenzó a poblarse exhaustivamente tras la Independencia. En la segunda mitad del siglo XIX y principios del siglo XX el barrio adquiriría notoriedad como uno de los barrios más selectos del Puerto, razón por la que inmigrantes británicos, alemanes y yugoslavos edificarían aquí sus palacios y casas. Con el declive económico de Valparaíso a mediados del siglo XX, estas colonias europeas comenzaron a emigrar y los chilenos ocuparían su lugar como pobladores del cerro. Es en este periodo que el puerto ganó «en nostálgica belleza lo que perdió en poderío económico» y en este proceso el cerro cumplió un rol central.[1]\\u200b\\n\\n\\n## Anteriores nombres y sus orígenes El primer nombre que recibió la zona fue «cerro del Cabo» debido a la prominencia rocosa sobre el mar que era el cerro en tiempos de la Colonia, mucho antes de que se le ganara terreno al mar; el nombre hacía referencia al Cabo de Hornos, esto debido a la peligrosidad que representaba para los navíos de la Corona Hispánica en las tempestades y temporales que azotaban a esta zona del Pacífico Sur en invierno, cuando Valparaíso carecía de obras de abrigo como espigones, escollones y malecones. La línea donde chocaba el mar contra el cerro puede ser ubicada hoy donde se encuentra el edificio de El Mercurio. \\n\\nOtro nombre que recibió fue el de «cerro del Chivato»,[2]\\u200b una bestia infernal que supuestamente habitaba una cueva a los pies del cerro, la que por aquel entonces daba al mar. Sin embargo, se cree que esta leyenda fue importada por marineros, acostumbrados a crear historias tenebrosas sobre puertos peligrosos, esto se sustenta en la presencia de mitos similares en puertos de la ruta marina entre Valparaíso y Europa. Lo que sí es cierto es que la cueva era temida de mucho antes de la llegada de los españoles a la zona. De acuerdo a una cita de Víctor Rojas Farías, estudioso del mundo mítico porteño: Los indígenas, que están siendo cristianizados, han confesado que esa cueva es temida desde hace mucho antes. Y los cristianos advierten que a su alrededor no aparecen sobrevivientes de los naufragios, ni se acumulan —cuando está la marea baja— cadáveres de lobos marinos, aveces y peces extraños que siempre están llegando a las orillas; porque la bahía hierve de vida y —donde hay vida— hay muerte. Mucha muerte...[1]\\u200b El cerro recibió su nombre por el castillo de la Concepción, una fortaleza construida por los españoles en 1678 para proteger la zona de incursiones piratas y corsarias. El castillo estaba guarnecido por cincuenta soldados y artilleros; se encontraba ubicado en una zona alejada de la población de Valparaíso de aquella época, dada su naturaleza defensiva. Con el tiempo, este castillo perdió importancia en pos del Castillo de San José, construido en la Cerro Cordillera. Sin embargo, el castillo terminó por cimentar el nombre del cerro.  El castillo de la Concepción se encuentra, en la actualidad, en el lugar donde está el Hotel Brighton en el Paseo Mirador Atkinson.\\nDurante la belle époque de la zona, el cerro fue conocido como Mount Pleasant figurando, incluso, avisos de venta de casas y challets con este nombre en el diario El Mercurio.\\n\\n\\n## Historia Después del saqueo de Panamá la Vieja —ciudad que existía cerca de la actual Ciudad de Panamá hasta su destrucción por parte del corsario Henry Morgan en 1671—, el virrey del Perú, Pedro Antonio Fernández de Castro, ordenó al gobernador de Chile, Juan Henríquez de Villalobos, construir en Valparaíso «uno o más fuertes y yo le envió para su defensa ocho cañones» con el objetivo de prevenir posibles ataques futuros.[3]\\u200b\\nSin embargo, la pobreza del reino y las prioridades urgentes que debían abordarse, dificultaron el avance en la construcción de dichas fortificaciones. Por lo tanto, en 1674, bajo el mandato del virrey Baltasar de la Cueva y Enríquez de Cabrera, se autorizó al gobernador para utilizar el producto del impuesto del almojarifazgo durante dos años para la construcción del castillo. Éste fue colocado en una posición elevada que dominaba la bahía desde el sur y recibió el nombre de castillo de la Concepción.[4]\\u200b\\nEl historiador Benjamín Vicuña Mackenna definía al Valparaíso colonial como «una aldea de frailes y cañones». Esto aplicaba, en efecto, al cerro Concepción. Apenas poblado por el castillo y un puñado de monjes, de hecho, hasta 1724 el cerro fue propiedad de la Orden de San Agustín, año en que el cerro fue vendido al capitán Luis García Venegas. \\nNo sería hasta bien entrado el siglo XIX y, ya con la Independencia superada, que el cerro Concepción se urbanizaría ni poblaría adecuadamente. Por aquel entonces se seguía percibiendo al cerro como un núcleo urbano aparte, alejado del Valparaíso urbano, más cercano al Almendral. Prueba de esto hallamos en la construcción del polvorín de cerro Cárcel y los primeros cementerios en cerro Panteón erigidos en 1825, ambos proyectos concebidos para las “afueras de Valparaíso”.\\nLa primera edificación civil de la que se tiene constancia en la zona data de 1822. Y perteneció a William Bateman, un comerciante inglés que fue asesinado por su propia servidumbre en su mansión años más tarde.\\nFue en 1833 cuando otro comerciante británico, Josué Waddington, adquirió la zona del cabo y procedió a dinamitar la parte baja, eliminando el peñasco, exponiendo la ya renombrada cueva del Chivato y dando inicio a las obras que permitirían el ensanchamiento de las calles del plan y la expansión de Valparaíso hacia el mar. Es en esta época que se considera que cerro Alegre y Concepción pasaron a ser parte integral de la ciudad.\\nEl cerro Concepción es una zona que no puede ser separada de su vecino, el cerro Alegre, debido —entre otras cosas— a que a partir de 1822, ambas regiones recibieron a miembros de colonias extranjeras, siendo la colonia británica la primera en asentarse en el cerro Alegre, mientras que en el Concepción fue hogar de una importante comunidad alemana. Estos inmigrantes, atraídos por el aire fresco, la vista al mar y la tranquilidad de estar alejados del bullicio central, diseñaron un urbanismo diverso que incluía pasajes y miradores, mansiones elegantes y jardines florecidos. Para 1840, estos barrios ofrecían un entorno europeo con un estilo arquitectónico predominantemente inglés. La catedral anglicana de Saint Paul fue construida por los británicos en 1857, mientras que los alemanes erigieron la iglesia luterana de la Santa Cruz en 1897. \\nEn 1856, el alumbrado público fue introducido en Valparaíso y el cerro Concepción recibió quince farolas de gas, los cuales reemplazaron a los antiguos faroles a sebo o parafina. \\nSegún el censo de 1880, la población de Valparaíso alcanzaba los 100.515 habitantes y, según la carta topográfica de 1884 dirigida por Recaredo Santos Tornero, la subdelegación n.º 8, el cerro Concepción, contaba con 4.971 habitantes.\\nEn 1883 fue inaugurado el Ascensor Concepción, el más antiguo de los ascensores de la ciudad. Éste conecta el pasaje Elías, frente al Reloj Turri con el paseo Gervasoni del cerro. Fue declarado Monumento Histórico en 1998. Durante sus primeros años funcionaba con un sistema de contrapesos de agua y calderas a vapor, eventualmente se cambió a un sistema eléctrico.\\n\\n\\n## Lugares típicos La catedral anglicana Saint Paul es uno de los monumentos más preciados del cerro. Construida por el ingeniero inglés William Lloyd en 1858, fue el primer templo de esta confesión que profesaba la mayoría de los miembros de la colonia británica residente. La construcción fue polémica debido a la mayoría católica de Valparaíso, razón por la que no les fue permitido erigir una torre ni tener puerta principal mirando hacia el altar.[5]\\u200b En 1897 los alemanes levantaron la iglesia Luterana de Valparaíso, ubicada a un par de cuadras de la anglicana. \\nOtro de los atractivos es el ascensor Concepción, inaugurado el 1 de diciembre de 1883, cuyos carros de madera eran accionados por contrapeso, según un sistema hidráulico que operaba mediante estanques de agua, ubicados en ambos lados del recorrido. El ascensor continúa siendo un medio cómodo y agradable de subir al Concepción.[6]\\u200b \\nTambién destacan dentro del cerro los miradores con espectaculares vistas a la bahía, como los de los paseos Pierre Loty, Atkinson y Gervasoni. El Yugoslavo prácticamente une los cerros Concepción y Alegre, por lo que para subir se puede elegir también el ascensor El Peral, que lleva desde la plaza de Justicia hasta el citado paseo, donde en el Palacio Baburizza tiene su sede el Museo Municipal de Bellas Artes.[7]\\u200b \\nEn el paseo Gervasoni tiene su sede la Casa Mirador Lukas, que es tanto un museo del famoso caricaturista como una sala de exposiciones.[8]\\u200b\\n\\n\\n## Referencias \\n\\n## Enlaces externos  Wikimedia Commons alberga una categoría multimedia sobre Cerro Concepción.\\nCiudadanos del Cerro Concepción.\\nIglesia Saint Paul's.\\nIglesia Luterana de Valparaíso.\", 'j05edJz5Xwy0', 'https://img.icons8.com/?size=150&id=j05edJz5Xwy0', '', '#f5f5f5', '#939393'], ['Paseo Gervasoni', 'site', 'neighbourhood', 'Valparaiso', 'Chile', 'https://www.google.com/maps/search/?api=1&query=Paseo%20Gervasoni%20P.%C2%BA%20Gervasoni%2C%20Valpara%C3%ADso%2C%20Chile', 'https://citymapper.com/directions?endcoord=-33.0412166,-71.6267058&endname=Paseo%20Gervasoni', '{\"types\":[\"route\"],\"geometry\":{\"location_type\":\"GEOMETRIC_CENTER\",\"viewport\":{\"northeast\":{\"lat\":-33.0399255197085,\"lng\":-71.62544996970851},\"southwest\":{\"lat\":-33.0426234802915,\"lng\":-71.62814793029152}},\"location\":{\"lng\":-71.6267058,\"lat\":-33.0412166},\"bounds\":{\"northeast\":{\"lat\":-33.0410833,\"lng\":-71.6264513},\"southwest\":{\"lat\":-33.0414657,\"lng\":-71.6271466}}},\"formatted_address\":\"P.º Gervasoni, Valparaíso, Chile\",\"place_id\":\"ChIJQ0r4pi7hiZYRUDdubKpCT_Q\",\"address_components\":[{\"long_name\":\"Paseo Gervasoni\",\"types\":[\"route\"],\"short_name\":\"P.º Gervasoni\"},{\"types\":[\"locality\",\"political\"],\"long_name\":\"Valparaíso\",\"short_name\":\"Valparaíso\"},{\"types\":[\"administrative_area_level_3\",\"political\"],\"short_name\":\"Valparaíso\",\"long_name\":\"Valparaíso\"},{\"types\":[\"administrative_area_level_2\",\"political\"],\"short_name\":\"Valparaiso\",\"long_name\":\"Valparaiso\"},{\"types\":[\"administrative_area_level_1\",\"political\"],\"short_name\":\"Valparaíso\",\"long_name\":\"Valparaíso\"},{\"long_name\":\"Chile\",\"short_name\":\"CL\",\"types\":[\"country\",\"political\"]}]}', '-33.0412166', '-71.6267058', 'Paseo Gervasoni', 'P.º Gervasoni', 'P.º Gervasoni, Valparaíso, Chile', 'GEOMETRIC_CENTER', 'ChIJQ0r4pi7hiZYRUDdubKpCT_Q', 'paseo gervasoni valparaiso chile', 'en', 'https://en.wikipedia.org/?curid=70566', 'Valparaíso', '70566', '<span class=\"searchmatch\">Valparaíso</span> (Spanish: [balpaɾaˈiso]) is a major city, commune, seaport and naval base facility in <span class=\"searchmatch\">Valparaíso</span> Region, <span class=\"searchmatch\">Chile</span>.

Valparaíso was named originally for Valparaíso de Arriba, in Castile-La Mancha, Spain. It is located about 120 km (75 mi) northwest of Santiago, by road, and is one of the Pacific Ocean\\'s most important seaports. Valparaíso is the capital of Chile\\'s second most-populated administrative region and has been the  Chilean Navy headquarters since 1817, as well as being the seat of the Chilean National Congress (since 1990). \\nValparaíso played an important geopolitical role in the second half of the 19th century when it served as a major stopover for ships traveling between the Atlantic and Pacific oceans via  the Straits of Magellan. The area experienced rapid growth during its golden age as a magnet for European immigrants, when the city was known by international sailors as \"Little San Francisco\" and \"jewel of the Pacific\". Notable acquisitions from this golden age include Latin America\\'s oldest stock exchange, the continent\\'s first volunteer fire department, Chile\\'s first public library, and the oldest Spanish language newspaper in continuous publication in the world, El Mercurio de Valparaíso. In 2003, the historic quarter of Valparaíso was declared a UNESCO World Heritage Site.\\nThe twentieth century was unfavorable to Valparaíso, as many wealthy families abandoned the city. The opening of the Panama Canal in 1914, and the associated reduction in ship traffic, dealt a serious blow to the region\\'s shipping- and port-based economy. By the 21st century, the port of San Antonio had surpassed Valparaíso in trade volume (TEU) handled, leading to the questioning of its traditional moniker of Puerto Principal (\"principal port\") of Chile. \\nBetween the years of 2000 to 2015, the city experienced a recovery, attracting artists, tourists, and cultural entrepreneurs, who settled after they were attracted by the city\\'s hillside historic districts. Today, many thousands of people visit Valparaíso each month, from Chile and abroad, to enjoy the city\\'s labyrinth of cobbled alleys and colorful buildings. The Port of Valparaíso still continues to be a major distribution center for container traffic, copper, and fruit exports. It also receives growing attention from cruise ships that visit during the South American summer. Most significantly, Valparaíso has transformed itself into a major educational and entertainment hub, with four large traditional universities, and several large vocational colleges. \\nWhile the city is well-known for its artisans and bohemian culture, it is also famous as the home of several highly-regarded music festivals and other artistic events. The largest, and arguably most iconic, is the annual Viña Del Mar International Song Festival (often simply called \"Viña\" or \"Viña Del Mar\"). Typically held in March, in a recently-refurbished, 40,000-capacity amphitheater, \"Viña\" is one of the biggest annual economic boosts to the region, as the event usually sells-out completely, and thousands of attendees and workers will travel to and stay in the city and metro area. In addition to showcasing numerous performers of many styles, and awarding various prizes, the internationally-televised and live-streamed festival is typically headlined by superstar musicians, from both the Spanish- and English-speaking worlds.\\n\\n\\n## History \\nSome older works starting with Benjamín Vicuña Mackenna (1869) claim that Valparaíso was within the range of the Chango people, but clear evidence for this is lacking.\\nThe Bay of Valparaíso\\'s first ethnically identifiable population were Picunche natives, known for their agriculture. Spanish explorers, considered the first European discoverers of Chile, arrived in 1536, aboard the Santiaguillo, a supply ship sent by Diego de Almagro. The Santiaguillo carried men and supplies for Almagro\\'s expedition, under the command of Juan de Saavedra, who named the town after his native village of Valparaíso de Arriba in Cuenca Province, Spain.\\n\\nDuring Spanish colonial times, Valparaíso remained a small village, with only a few houses and a church. On some occasions she was attacked by English pirates and privateers, such as Francis Drake with his ship Golden Hind in 1578 and later his cousin Richard Hawkins with his ship Dainty in 1594. Drake\\'s sack of Valparaíso gave origin to the legend about Cueva del Pirata.\\n\\nIn 1810, a wealthy merchant built the first pier in the history of Chile and the first during the colonial era. In its place today, stands the building of El Mercurio de Valparaíso. The ocean then rose to this point. Reclamation of land from the sea moved the coastline five blocks away. Between 1810 and 1830, he built much of the existing port of the city, including much of the land reclamation work that now comprises the city\\'s commercial centre. \\nIn 1814, the naval Battle of Valparaíso was fought offshore of the town, between American and British ships involved in the War of 1812. After Chile\\'s independence from Spain (1818), beginning the Republican Era, Valparaíso became the main harbour for the nascent Chilean navy, and opened international trade opportunities that had been formerly limited to Spain and its other colonies.\\n\\nValparaíso soon became a desired stopover for ships rounding South America via the Straits of Magellan and Cape Horn. It gained particular importance supporting and supplying the California Gold Rush (1848–1858). As a major seaport, Valparaíso received immigrants from many European countries, mainly from Britain, Germany, France, Switzerland and Italy. German, French, Italian and English were commonly spoken among its citizens, who founded and published newspapers in these languages.\\nValparaíso found maritime competition with Callao (Perú). Both cities sought to be the dominant port on the Pacific Coast of South America during the period of time known as the High Trade (1880–1930). \\nThe British community, La Colonia Britanica, prospered in Valparaíso between the 1820s and 1920s. Firms such as Antony Gibbs & Sons, Duncan Fox, and Williamson-Balfour Company were doing business in the town, which had become a significant trading center by 1840, with 166 British ships, out of a total of 287, anchored in its port. The British settled on Cerro Alegre (Mount Pleasant) and Cerro Concepción. The Association of Voluntary Firemen was created in 1851, a telegraph service to Santiago was operating by 1852, and Chile\\'s first telephone service was set up in 1880. The British Hospital was founded in 1897, and the British Arch, Arco Británico, was erected in 1911. However, by 1895, Italian immigrants exceeded the British, and both the Italians and Germans were in larger numbers by 1907. By 1920, both the Italians and Spanish outnumbered the British, and the primary British community within Chile resided in Santiago. \\n\\nInternational immigration transformed the local culture from Spanish origins and Amerindian origins, in ways that included the construction of the first non-Catholic cemetery of Chile, the Dissidents\\' Cemetery. Football (soccer) was introduced to Chile by English immigrants; and the first private Catholic school in Chile, Le Collège des Sacrés Cœurs (\"Sacred Hearts College\") and its accompanying Sacred Hearts Church, by French immigrants. Immigrants from Scotland and Germany founded the first private secular schools (The Mackay School and Die Deutsche Schule, respectively). Immigrants formed the first volunteer fire-fighting units (still a volunteer activity in Chile). Their buildings reflected a variety of European styles, making Valparaíso more varied than some other Chilean cities.\\nOn 18 August 1906, a major earthquake struck Valparaíso; there was extensive property damage and thousands of deaths. The Chilean doctor, Carlos Van Buren, of U.S. descent, was involved in the medical care of earthquake victims. He later established the Hospital  Carlos Van Buren in 1912.\\nThe golden age of Valparaíso\\'s commerce ended after the opening of the Panama Canal in 1914. Shipping shifted to the canal as captains sought to avoid the risks of the Strait of Magellan. The port\\'s use and traffic declined significantly, causing a decline in the city\\'s economy. The opening of the Panama Canal was one of the most critical events in the shaping of Valparaío\\'s economy. Since the turn of the 21st century, shipping has increased in the last few decades with fruit exports, opening the Chilean economy to world commerce, and larger-scale, Post-Panamax ships that do not fit the Panama Canal.\\n\\n## 19th century On 28 March 1814, the USS Essex was defeated by British frigates Phoebe and Cherub during the War of 1812, leading to the deaths of 58 US Marines. Captain David Porter, a survivor of this attack, would retire to Portersville, Indiana, and request changing the name to Valparaiso, commemorating the only naval battle he ever lost. By 2 August 1820, the Liberating Expedition of Peru sailed from Valparaíso.\\nAt 10:30 pm on the evening of 19 November 1822, Valparaíso experienced a violent earthquake that left the city in ruins; of the 16,000 residents, casualties included at least 66 adults and 12 children, as well as 110 people wounded. The next day, a meteor trail was visible from Quillota to Valparaíso, seen as a religious experience for much of the population.\\nIn 1826, the Royal Navy Great Britain established a South America Station in Valparaíso to maintain British naval interest in the region. It would remain until 1837, when it was relocated to Esquimalt, British Columbia. 12 September 1827 saw the establishment of El Mercurio de Valparaíso, the oldest circulating newspaper in the Spanish language worldwide.\\nIn May 1828, a constitutional convention began regular meetings in the church of San Francisco. By August 9, the Constitution of the Republic of Chile was fully drafted and disseminated.\\nOn 6 June 1837, Minister Diego Portales was shot at the port outside of Baron Hill on suspicion of promoting conspirators who opposed the Peru-Bolivian Confederation, considered a turning point of Chilean public opinion and the purpose of the war.\\nBy 1851, the first fire brigade in the country was formed. The next year potable running water became available, as well as the first telegraph service in Latin America, between the city and Santiago. It would be another four years before streetlights, with 700 gas lanterns, were installed. In 1861 the first tram company was formed, mostly using horses or mules to draw them, and fully established over the next few years.\\nIn 1852, British shipping company Williamson, Balfour & Cía was established in Valparaíso to handle trade in the region. \\nTaking advantage of the total lack of defenses, a Spanish fleet commanded by Casto Méndez Núñez bombarded the city during the Chincha Islands War in 1866. Chilean merchant ships were sunk, except for those vessels whose captains hoisted foreign flags.\\nA merger of the National Steamship Company and Chilean Steamship Company, the South American Steamship Company was created as a national response to the increasing dominance of the Pacific Steam Navigation Company in 1872. In 1880 the Chilean Telephone Company was formed by Americans Joseph Husbands, Peter MacKellar, James Martin, and the US consul Lucius Foot, the first official telephone company in the country. Three years later on the first of December, Concepción funicular opened, the first of many hydraulic systems. After the country\\'s independence and its consequent openness to international trade, Valparaíso became an important port of call on trade routes through the Eastern Pacific. Many immigrants settled there, mostly from Europe and North America, who helped include Valparaíso and Chile in the Industrial Revolution sweeping other parts of the world. This created a different city with civil, financial, commercial and industrial institutions, many of which still exist today.\\nAll this resulted in a population increases. The city reached more than 160,000 inhabitants in the late nineteenth century, making it necessary to use the steep hills for more houses, mansions and even cemeteries. The lack of available land caused the city authorities and developers to reclaim low lying tidal marshland (polders) upon which to build administrative, commercial and industrial infrastructure.\\n\\n## 20th century The twentieth century began with the first big protest of dockworkers, Chile on 15 April 1903, due to complaints by dockers about their excessive working hours and demands for higher wages, requests that were ignored by employers, creating a tense situation that led to serious violence on 12 May. There were protests and the burning of the CSAV offices and several people were shot and killed. All this prompted intervention by the state. This protest was important for the future of Trade Unionism in the country.\\nThat same year, electric trams were introduced.\\nThe 1906 Valparaíso earthquake caused severe damage throughout the city on 16 August, which was at that time the heart of the Chilean economy. The damage was valued at hundreds of millions of pesos of the time, and human victims were counted at 3,000 dead and over 20,000 injured. After the removal of the debris, reconstruction work began. This included the widening of streets, culverting and covering streams, (Jaime and Delicias – creating the avenues Francia and Argentina respectively). The main street of the city (Pedro Montt) was laid and Plaza O\\'Higgins was created; a hill was removed to allow the passage of Colon Street. The damaged Edwards mansion was demolished and in its place, the present Cathedral of Valparaíso was built and, among many other works, this gave shape to the Almendral Valparaíso area.\\nIn 1910, the port expansion work of the city, which ended in 1930, began. A long breakwater was built, along with piers and docking terminals.\\nThe Imperial German East Asia Squadron engaged the British West Indies Squadron on 1 November 1914 at the Battle of Coronel off the coast of Valparaiso, sinking two British cruisers. After the battle the East Asia Squadron stayed in Valparaiso Harbor before continuing to the Falklands.\\n\\n## 21st century Chile\\'s legislature along with other institutions of national importance like the National Customs Service, the National Fish and Aquaculture Ministry, the Ministry of Culture and the Barracks General of the Chilean Navy are sited in the city. In addition to the capital of the Valparaíso Region hosts the Regional Administration and government.\\nIn 2003, Valparaíso became an UNESCO World Heritage Centre. This title was awarded to Valparaiso for its unique urban form, as well as its clear maintained historical background as a colorful port city. In becoming a World Heritage Center, Valparaíso is tasked with maintaining its cultural heritage, through the maintenance of its historic infrastructure, like its Ascensores.\\nOn 13 April 2014, a huge brush fire burned out of control, destroying 2,800 homes and killing 16 people, forcing President Michelle Bachelet to declare it a disaster zone.\\nIn early February 2024, a huge brush fire burned through Valparaiso and central Chile, killing at least 131 people.\\n\\n\\n## Geography \\nValparaíso is located in central Chile, 120 km (75 mi) to the north west of the capital Santiago. Valparaíso, like most of Chile, is vulnerable to earthquakes. Before the earthquake of February 27, 2010, which measured 8.8 on the moment magnitude scale, the last catastrophic earthquake to strike Valparaíso devastated the city in August 1906, killing nearly 3,000 people. Other significant earthquakes to affect the city were the 1730 Valparaíso earthquake and the 1985 Algarrobo earthquake.\\n\\n## Geology =Because of Valparaíso\\'s proximity to the Peru–Chile Trench, the city is vulnerable to earthquakes. The Peru–Chile Trench stores large amounts of energy for a very long time and sometimes ruptures after short intervals in a violent earthquake.\\n\\n## Climate =Valparaíso has a very mild Mediterranean climate (Köppen Csb). The summer is essentially dry, but the city is affected by fogs from the Humboldt Current during most of the year. In the winter, rainfall can occasionally be extremely heavy when a powerful frontal system crosses central Chile, but frequency of such rains varies greatly from year to year. Monthly average temperatures vary just around 6°C between the coolest and the warmest month, from 17 °C (63 °F) in January to 11.4 °C (52.5 °F) in July. Snowfall occurs rarely in the highest parts of the city. In winter, strong winds can lead to wind chill temperatures below freezing.\\n\\n\\n## Cityscape \\nNicknamed \"The Jewel of the Pacific\", Valparaíso was declared a world heritage site based upon its improvised urban design and unique architecture. In 1996, the World Monuments Fund declared Valparaíso\\'s unusual system of funicular lifts (steeply inclined carriages) one of the world\\'s 100 most endangered historical treasures. In 1998, grassroots activists convinced the Chilean government and local authorities to apply for UNESCO world heritage status for Valparaíso. Valparaíso was declared a World Heritage Site in 2003. Built upon dozens of steep hillsides overlooking the Pacific Ocean, Valparaíso has a labyrinth of streets and cobblestone alleyways, embodying a rich architectural and cultural legacy. Valparaíso is protected as a UNESCO World Heritage Site.\\nSince its status as a World Heritage Site, Valparaíso has made several changes to its urban fabric in the process of maintaining its cultural heritage.\\nLandmarks include:\\n\\nIglesia de la Matriz\\nPlaza Aníbal Pinto\\nPlaza Sotomayor including the Edificio Armada de Chile\\nEdificio Luis Cousiño\\nCourthouse\\n16 remaining funiculars (called ascensores): 15 public (national monuments) and 1 private (which belongs to \"Hospital Carlos Van Buren\").\\nThe Concepcion and Alegre historical district\\nThe Bellavista hill, which has the \"Museo a Cielo Abierto\" or \"open air museum\"\\nMonument to Admiral Lord Thomas Alexander Cochrane, 10th Earl of Dundonald\\nMonument to Manuel Blanco Encalada, first Chilean President\\nCapilla del Carmen\\nCemeteries on Panteón Hill – Cemetery Number One (Catholic) and Dissidents Cemetery (Protestant)\\n=', 'j05edJz5Xwy0', 'https://img.icons8.com/?size=150&id=j05edJz5Xwy0', '', '#f5f5f5', '#939393'], ['Cerro Alegre', 'site', 'neighbourhood', 'Valparaiso', 'Chile', 'https://www.google.com/maps/search/?api=1&query=Cerro%20Alegre%20P.%C2%BA%20Dimalow%20290%2C%202371566%20Valpara%C3%ADso%2C%20Chile', 'https://citymapper.com/directions?endcoord=-33.0431013,-71.6279286&endname=Cerro%20Alegre', '{\"plus_code\":{\"global_code\":\"47RCX94C+QR\",\"compound_code\":\"X94C+QR Valparaíso, Chile\"},\"geometry\":{\"viewport\":{\"southwest\":{\"lat\":-33.0445100802915,\"lng\":-71.6292686302915},\"northeast\":{\"lng\":-71.6265706697085,\"lat\":-33.0418121197085}},\"location_type\":\"ROOFTOP\",\"location\":{\"lat\":-33.0431013,\"lng\":-71.6279286}},\"address_components\":[{\"long_name\":\"290\",\"types\":[\"street_number\"],\"short_name\":\"290\"},{\"short_name\":\"P.º Dimalow\",\"types\":[\"route\"],\"long_name\":\"Paseo Dimalow\"},{\"types\":[\"locality\",\"political\"],\"long_name\":\"Valparaíso\",\"short_name\":\"Valparaíso\"},{\"long_name\":\"Valparaíso\",\"short_name\":\"Valparaíso\",\"types\":[\"administrative_area_level_3\",\"political\"]},{\"types\":[\"administrative_area_level_2\",\"political\"],\"short_name\":\"Valparaiso\",\"long_name\":\"Valparaiso\"},{\"long_name\":\"Valparaíso\",\"types\":[\"administrative_area_level_1\",\"political\"],\"short_name\":\"Valparaíso\"},{\"types\":[\"country\",\"political\"],\"long_name\":\"Chile\",\"short_name\":\"CL\"},{\"short_name\":\"2371566\",\"types\":[\"postal_code\"],\"long_name\":\"2371566\"}],\"place_id\":\"ChIJ0ZoN7y7hiZYRFPyPwB0iPx0\",\"types\":[\"establishment\",\"point_of_interest\"],\"formatted_address\":\"P.º Dimalow 290, 2371566 Valparaíso, Chile\"}', '-33.0431013', '-71.6279286', 'Paseo Dimalow', 'P.º Dimalow', 'P.º Dimalow 290, 2371566 Valparaíso, Chile', 'ROOFTOP', 'ChIJ0ZoN7y7hiZYRFPyPwB0iPx0', 'cerro alegre paseo dimalow valparaiso chile', 'es', 'https://es.wikipedia.org/?curid=795967', 'Cerro Alegre', '795967', '<span class=\"searchmatch\">Cerro</span> <span class=\"searchmatch\">Alegre</span> es un barrio de la ciudad de <span class=\"searchmatch\">Valparaíso</span>, <span class=\"searchmatch\">Chile</span> y se encuentra sobre el centro político y financiero de la ciudad.

Su nombre se debe a los bellos jardines que adornaban las casas del sector, que en el siglo XIX estaba habitado principalmente por inmigrantes ingleses. \\nFormula una unidad geográfica y cultural con el vecino Cerro Concepción. Cerro Alegre es barrio de un conjunto de sitios atractivos, como restaurantes, miradores, hoteles de lujo, hostales y otros alojamientos más tradicionales. \\n\\n\\n## Geografía El barrio de Cerro Alegre está comprendido por las calles Almirante Montt y José Tomás Ramos en sus extremos laterales, Calle Prat en su extremo inferior y calle Carlos Pezoa Veliz en su extremo superior. Limita con los barrios Puerto y Cerro Cordillera hacia el norte, Financiero y el centro de Valparaíso hacia el este, Cerro Cárcel hacia el sur y Playa Ancha Alto hacia el oeste.\\nTiene una superficie de unos 0,7 km² y una población de 6 124 habitantes según el censo del 2017. Su densidad de población es de 15 310 habitantes/km².\\n\\n\\n## Historia Distinguidos capitanes de la conquista fueron los primeros habitantes del cerro Alegre, cuyos terrenos correspondían a una de las mercedes otorgadas por Pedro de Valdivia a oficiales que encabezaban las tropas en las diferentes campañas. Los capitanes Juan Rodrigo de Guzmán y Nicolás Octavio fueron los primeros españoles en instalarse en el cerro. En 1672, ambos donaron sus terrenos a la orden de los agustinos; medio siglo después, en 1724, el prior Miguel Arrué los vendió nuevamente a un militar, al capitán Luis García Venegas.[1]\\u200b\\nEn 1822,el comerciante William Bateman construyó la primera casa y un camino para subir. Le siguió John Martin, también británico. Tras el terremoto de 1822, se comenzó a construir casonas de estilo arquitectónico inglés y una iglesia protestante. El barrio fue poblado por la naciente burguesía comerciante local, en su mayoría británicos y alemanes.\\nEn la segunda mitad del siglo XIX, vivían en Cerro Alegre Samuel Oxley, Jorge Rose Innes, los comerciantes Templeman y David Allerdice, el constructor de barcos Juan Atkinson y el presbiteriano David Trumbull.\\nTras la independencia, los porteños criollos lo llamaban cerro Alegre, y los ingleses residentes Mount Pleasent. Se le conoció también como cerro de los Judíos. Para llegar al cerro desde el puerto, se debía subir por la Quebrada de San Agustín (actual Calle José Tomás Ramos), y luego subir por el Camino de los Aguadores, actual calle Estanque.\\nEn 1857 se fundó el Colegio Inglés Mc Kay en calle del Hospital (actual Guillermo Munnich), el colegio inglés más antiguo de Chile y posteriormente, el Saint Margaret\\'s British School for Girls. En 1877, se crea el Colegio de Nuestra Señora de la Misericordia y el Hospital Alemán, en el espacio que ocupó la Quinta Buchnann, obra de la colonia alemana de la ciudad y segundo hospital alemán de Sudamérica. En 1901, los residentes del barrio descendientes de ingleses, fundaron la décima primera CompañÍa de Bomberos \"George Garland\". Su cuartel estuvo en Montealgre, detrás de la parroquia.\\nEn 1909 se funda el club deportivo Everton en la casa de David Foxley. Este equipo de fútbol se trasladó a Viña del Mar debido a que la Asociación Central de Fútbol solo aceptaba un equipo oficial por ciudad. En 1991, por iniciativa del Rotary Club de Valparaíso, se crea el Centro de Capacitación Laboral \"Agustín Turner\".\\n\\n\\n## Sitios de interés \\n## Cerro Concepción =El cerro Concepción es en conjunto uno de los lugares más atractivos y turísticos de Valparaíso con restaurantes y miradores como el Paseo Mirador Atkinson y el Paseo Gervasoni. En este último se encuentra el ascensor Concepción, el primero de la ciudad. El sector toma su nombre por el Castillo Concepción, construido en 1676 en donde actualmente se encuentra el paseo Atkinson. Este cerro sirvió de unión del puerto de Valparaíso con el barrio El Almendral cuando aún no se ganaba terreno al mar. Fue uno de los primeros sectores altos de la ciudad en ser poblado.\\n\\n## Montealegre =En este sector se ubican casonas de carácter señorial. Vivió aquí el cirujano naval escocés Tomás Leighton, cuya calle de residencia fue renombrada en su honor. En calle Leighton vivió la familia Fontaine, Federico Rudolph, Alberto Karlezi y el senador Pedro Ibáñez Ojeda. Sobre calle Montealegre estaba la casa de la familia Karlsrusher, donde viviría posteriormente el alcalde Sergio Vuskovic. Otros vecinos ilustres del sector Montealegre fueron Arturo Vorwerk Klee, Sara Vial de los Heros, Thomas Somerscales, Medardo Espinoza, Rafael Luis Barahona, Lucía D\\'Ambra, la familia Vianello y Héctor Radrigán.\\n\\n## Paseo Yugoslavo =El paseo Yugoslavo es el lugar más representativo de cerro Alegre. Está ubicado a 45 metros sobre el nivel del mar en la salida de la estación superior del ascensor El Peral. Se encuentran aquí el Palacio Astoreca y el Museo de Bellas Artes de Valparaíso en las dependencias del Palacio Baburizza. \\nAnteriormente era conocido como Paseo Americano. La casas construidas en este sector remontan de afines del siglo XIX y principios del siglo XX, las cuales fueron financiadas con las fortunas obtenidas del salitre. Entre las ricas familias salitreras que se asentaron en el Paseo Yugoslavo se encuentran los Baburizza, los Zanelli, los Astoreca y los Antoncich.\\nEn 1916 se construyó el palacio de la familia Zanelli, el cual fue comprado en 1925 por Pascual Baburizza. En 1928, se remodeló el paseo a manos del arquitecto Vicente Callovich. \\n\\n\\n## Cultura \\n## Deportes =El deporte más popular en Cerro Alegre fue el baloncesto. En 1912, nació la organización New Crusaders, que tuvo su mayor éxito en 1950 tras derrotar a Unión Española, campeón durante 25 años seguidos del campeonato local y representantes de Chile en los Juegos Olímpicos de Berlín. Sus jugadores más destacados eran Hernán Raffo y Ortega. En su época del oro, el club tuvo ramas de atletismo, fútbol, natación y waterpolo. La cancha de basquetbol fue construida en 1958 y está al final del pasaje Santa Victorina.\\nEn lo que respecta al fútbol, el club deportivo Everton de Viña del Mar fue creado en Cerro Alegre. En atletismo, una de las figuras más destacadas fue Francisco Allen, quien rompió el récord sudamericano de 3000 metros con obstáculos el 21 de mayo de 1989.\\n\\n## Educación =Establecimientos de educación básica:\\n\\nEscuela Básica Montessori\\nEscuela Particular San Luis\\nColegio Bordemar\\nEstablecimientos de educación media:\\n\\nLiceo N°21 Pedro Montt\\nColegio Mar Abierto\\nColegio Montessori\\nColegio Nuestra Señora de la Misericordia\\nColegio Puerto Paz\\nColegio Internacional Valparaíso\\nEstablecimientos de educación superior:\\n\\nInstituto de Música de la Pontificia Universidad Católica de Valparaíso\\nCentro de Capacitación Laboral \"Agustín Turner\"\\n\\n## Iglesias y parroquias =Parroquia de San Luis Gonzaga.\\nIglesia Luterana de la Santa Cruz.\\nCapilla San Luis.\\nCatedral Anglicana de San Pablo.\\nIglesia de Jesucristo de los Santos de los Últimos Días, estaca Cerro Alegre.\\n\\n## Artes =Ubicada a la salida de la estación superior del ascensor Reina Victoria, la plazoleta Lukas, después de remodelada en 2014, se ha convertido en un especie de museo al aire libre en homenaje al famoso dibujante Renzo Pecchenino. Con apoyo de la Municipalidad de Valparaíso y la Fundación Lukas, los artistas Cynthia Aguilera (que también firma sola como Cines) y Sammy Espinoza (Jekse o Jehkse), dúo que firma sus grafitis como Unkolordistinto, han recreado los personajes del Bestiario del Reyno de Chile en los muros y tiendas de la pequeña plaza.[2]\\u200b\\nDesde ella se abren hermosas vistas del vecino cerro Concepción y, particularmente, de su iglesia luterana de La Santa Cruz. Aquí comienza el paseo Dimalow, con su hotel boutique Casa Vander, que da a la plazoleta y cuya cara norte, que mira al ascensor, está adornada en su parte inferior con el largo mural La gallada, personajes de Lukas pintados por Unkolordistinto.[2]\\u200b \\nEl paseo Dimalow es famoso tanto por las vistas que se aprecian desde él como por los murales que se pueden admirar al recorrerlo, entre los que destaca el inmenso personaje pintado por La Robot de Madera (se ve desde el comienzo del paseo, a la derecha, en la cara norte de un edificio), que tiene en su pecho una torre en llamas. Dimalow termina en la calle Almirante Montt, la que, a la derecha, conduce a la iglesia anglicana de San Pablo, que marca el comienzo del cerro Concepción.\\nLa estación superior del ascensor El Peral —cerrado por un año a partir del 1 de junio de 2015 para una \"recuperación integral\"—[3]\\u200b da a la calle del mismo nombre; a pocos pasos, a la izquierda, comienza el paseo Yugoslavo, con el magnífico Palacio Baburizza, sede del Museo Municipal de Bellas Artes, que tiene una valiosa colección de obras de artistas nacionales y extranjeros. Desde el paseo, que fue uno de los primeros miradores del puerto, se abre una bella panorámica de la bahía de Valparaíso. En este paseo, en la esquina oriente del Baburizza, está la calle Montealegre, que conecta con el cerro Concepción. \\nEn la calle Galos esquina Templeman, se encuentra la iglesia de san Luis de Gonzaga (conocida simplemente también como iglesia San Luis y oficialmente como Parroquia San Luis de Gonzaga), fundada en 1890 por los padres palotinos irlandeses ante la necesidad de contar con un lugar de culto católico en un sector poblado por inmigrantes que ya tenían el citado templo anglicano y el luterano de la Santa Cruz, ambos en el vecino cerro Concepción. Juana Ross de Edwards donó los terrenos para su construcción en 1890, que estuvo a cargo del arquitecto Nicanor Marambio[4]\\u200b y que duró dos años y medio: fue inaugurada el 8 de marzo de 1893.[5]\\u200b Después, desde 1934 y 1965, fue de los palotinos alemanes; fueron ellos, concretamente el párraco Clemente Klepper en 1935, quien la hizo partícipe del Movimiento apostólico de Schönstatt. Detrás de la iglesia está la plazuela San Luis, punto importante de conjunción de 6 calles: Almirante Montt, Capilla, Montealegre, Alemania, Múnich y Estanque. Junto con la parroquia, se fundó la Escuela San Luis, en la calle Cirilo Armstrong, que en un comienzo era solo de hombres; hoy es mixto\\n\\n\\n## Transporte \\n## Ascensores =Se puede acceder a Cerro Alegre desde el centro mediante:\\nAscensor Reina Victoria, inaugurado en 1902, con su estación baja en calle Elías y estación alta en paseo Dimalow, permite conectar Cerro Alegre con el centro de Valparaíso.\\nAscensor Concepción, inaugurado en 1883, con su estación baja en calle Prat y estación alta en paseo Gervasoni, permite conectar Cerro Concepción con el barrio Financiero.\\nAscensor El Peral, inaugurado en 1902, con su estación baja en Plaza Justicia y estación alta en paseo Yugoslavo, permite conectar Cerro Alegre con el barrio Puerto.\\n\\n## Transporte Metropolitano de Valparaíso =Cerro Alegre es un de los barrios con menor conectividad del Gran Valparaíso puesto que ninguna línea de autobús transita por el centro comercial y turístico del barrio. Sin embargo en el sector alto del barrio pasan las siguientes líneas:\\n\\n514 [Portales - Playa Ancha], por calle El Manzano\\n515 [Portales - Playa Ancha], por Avenida Alemania\\n607 [Reñaca - Cárcel Valparaíso], por Avenida Alemania\\n612 [Viña del Mar - Playa Ancha], por Avenida Alemania\\n613 [Viña del Mar - Playa Ancha], por Avenida Alemania\\n\\n## Taxis y colectivos =En Plaza Aníbal Pinto existe un paradero de taxis que suben a Cerro Alegre. A un costado existe un paradero de taxis colectivo que unen el centro de Valparaíso, Cerro Alegre y Playa Ancha Alto.

It is named after Rafael Sotomayor. The square is lined by buildings occupying full block-fronts of the streets that flank it. The focus of the square is the monument that honors the Chilean sailors who fell during the Battle of Iquique and the Battle of Punta Gruesa. The plaza and surrounding buildings was designated a Zona Típica (historic district) on January 23, 1979.\\n\\nAt the northeastern side of the square are two similar towers, which create a sort of gate entrance to the port from the city. On the opposite side is the building that housed the Intendencia de Valparaíso, which currently is home to the headquarters of the Chilean Navy. The building used by the CSAV and the building that houses the National Council of Culture and the Arts also face the plaza.\\nClose to the station is the western terminus station of the Valparaíso Metro, that replaced the old railway station.\\n\\n\\n## History Sotomayor Square originally called Plaza de la Aduana (Customs Square), then Plaza del Palacio (Palace Square) and later Plaza Intendencia (Intendancy Square), is the most important civic square in Valparaíso, which was built over previous sealand. The history of the city lays in it, consisting of buildings from different periods that merge into one big area. It didn't always have a trapezoid shape as it does today, which helps to create a different perspective effect, neither had the decisive axis between the main building — the former intendancy building — nor its view of the ocean. Originally, it was an esplanade in which filthy water descended sluggishly through San Agustín (Tomás Ramos) gorge, standing next to the current Plaza de la Justicia (Justice Square). Also, a large house near to Cerro Cordillera (Cordillera Hill) played the role of customs.\\nOn 10 June 1825 a storm broke the cables of the frigate Valdivia and stranded her on the beach that existed here. The authorities filled the hulk with sand in order to use it as a base for Valparaiso's first wharf for passengers and light cargo. Subsequently, in 1831, the passengers’ wharf started to be built, whose remains can be seen today at the museum right under the square.\\nAfter the construction of the first customs building, the most representative building of the city for almost seventy years, a square started to be built next to it. Although it was smaller and the building line was several meters ahead of the current facades, in the mid-century the latter was extended to Condell Street. In addition, some warehouses were built around it and also hotels and inns.\\nIn 1855 came into existence in this square the first bank in Chile called the Banco de Depósitos y Descuentos de Valparaíso (The Deposits and Discounts Bank of Valparaíso), occupying part of the current square in front of the land of the present National Council of Culture and the Arts. The Bolsa de Comercio building was constructed with wood and cane from Guayaquil in 1858 and designed by the architect Juan Berg, who created a porch to access the city from the sea. The Bolsa de Comercio was inaugurated in the same year, 6 May with a special ceremony led by the President of Chile, Manuel Montt. Additionally, in the year 1866, the city of Valparaíso was bombed by the Spanish Navy during the Chincha Islands War originating from a trade dispute between Spain and Peru. Although Spain tried to burn down the Bolsa de Comercio, the building survived the attack and it was repaired afterwards. The construction of the first Post Office, next to the Bank in the corner of the Aduana (Prat) Street, and the fire department building, between Blanco and Cochrane Streets, both dating from 1868, contributed decisively to the characterization of the square as a civic one. These were neoclassical buildings that would be later replaced in the first half of the 20th century by modern architecture but preserving its early use.\\nIn 1873, the square was already cobbled when the first sculpture of Valparaíso was built in 12 April, commemorating the Scottish seamen Lord Thomas Cochrane. In 1876, the railway crossed around the shore in front of the wharf and went from the current Errázuriz Street towards the Barrio Puerto (Port's Neighbourhood). In the same year, the construction of the Rose Company building took place, which was called Innes, and then Grace, whose facades remained until today as part of the Compañía Sudamericana de Vapores’ building. In 1885, the Bolsa de Comercio (The Stock Exchange) located in Valparaíso square right in front of the Hotel Reina Victoria (Queen Victoria Hotel) had to be demolished to install in its place the great monument to the fallen heroes in the Battle of Iquique and the crypt of the remains of Arturo Prat and his men, which would be inaugurated on 21 May 1886. The following year, a neoclassical building was built on the grounds of the current port station that was meant to serve as the administration of the Navy and other public uses, and would remain so until 1920. In 1883, a comfortable passengers’ wharf was ordered to be built. Made of wood and metal with hexagonal shape, this passengers’ wharf also known as Muelle Prat (Prat wharf), would last until 1912 when it was swept away by a storm. Until the early 20th century there was still a building in front of the Queen Victoria Hotel occupying part of the Estación Puerto (Port Station) and the customs building, which were built in the 30s.\\nIn 2000, the Ministry of Housing and Urban Development (es) inaugurated the work of remodeling the square, directed by the architect Harken Jensen, where a concession was granted for subterranean parking lots, and additionally, a museum was inaugurated due to archeological findings in the same place. In 2004, the design of the square extends to the Prat Wharf, turning it into a touristic walkway from which was possible to embark in order to cross the roadstead of Valparaíso from the sea. At the Prat wharf is possible to see a replica of the Santiaguillo (es), a small sailing boat which was the first Spaniard vessel to dock in this bay called Quintil.\\nThe first wharf completed in 1883 corresponds to the passengers’ wharf, made of wood and metal with hexagonal shape.\\n\", 'H4ubSTbctL4w', 'https://img.icons8.com/?size=150&id=H4ubSTbctL4w', '', '#fffde8', '#99978b'], ['Caleta Portales', 'cultural_site', 'marine', 'Valparaiso', 'Chile', 'https://www.google.com/maps/search/?api=1&query=Caleta%20Portales%20Av.%20Espa%C3%B1a%202351%2C%20Valpara%C3%ADso%2C%20Chile', 'https://citymapper.com/directions?endcoord=-33.0313669,-71.5905569&endname=Caleta%20Portales', '{\"types\":[\"establishment\",\"point_of_interest\",\"tourist_attraction\"],\"plus_code\":{\"global_code\":\"47RCXC95+FQ\",\"compound_code\":\"XC95+FQ Valparaíso, Chile\"},\"formatted_address\":\"Av.

Los estudios comenzaron en 1897, encargados por el Ministerio de Industria y Obras Públicas, que designó una «Junta del Camino Plano», dirigida por Enrique Budge, y que tenía como misión construir una calzada carretera, a un costado de la línea férrea contigua al mar, con el ancho suficiente para instalar una vía de tranvías.[3]\\u200b\\nA pesar de la oposición de la Empresa de los Ferrocarriles del Estado al nuevo uso de parte de sus terrenos,[1]\\u200b en 1899 comenzaron las obras para la construcción del camino a un costado de la vía ferroviaria, con el desmonte de los cerros que llegaban a la línea y el aplanamiento de un ancho de 10 metros.[2]\\u200b El 28 de enero de 1906 se inauguró la vía con el nombre de Camino Plano en una ceremonia realizada en la estación Viña del Mar por el intendente Joaquín Fernández Blanco.[1]\\u200b[4]\\u200b El sector más cercano a Valparaíso, entre la estación Barón y la Caleta Portales, fue el único que fue cubierto con adoquines de piedra y piedra de río.[3]\\u200b\\nEl incremento del tráfico y los primeros automóviles, sumado a la escasa mantención, llevaron al deterioro de la obra. La pavimentación total del camino comenzó en 1916 y sus obras fueron inauguradas el 1 de octubre de 1922, cuando fue finalmente denominada avenida España.[4]\\u200b[5]\\u200b\\n\\n\\n## Características Es una de las avenidas con mayor caudal de tránsito de la región y las más transitadas del país; se inicia en el Nudo Barón, Valparaíso, y finaliza en el eje Viana - Álvares en Viña del Mar. Se encuentra en el borde costero, con vista constante al océano Pacífico.\\nEn su recorrido se ubican tres estaciones de metro: Barón, Portales y Recreo. Dentro de su extensión es posible apreciar la Universidad Técnica Federico Santa María, el instituto profesional Inacap y la caleta Portales. \\nEsta vía está a las faldas de los cerros Barón (en ella se encuentra la estación baja del ascensor del mismo nombre), Placeres, Esperanza y Recreo. Además se encuentra el Portal Valparaíso en el sector del Nudo Barón y próximo al final de la Avenida, en caleta Abarca, están el Reloj de flores y el Hotel Sheraton Miramar. Al costado norte de la vía se extienden las playas Caleta Abarca en Viña del Mar y Los Placeres/Portales en Valparaíso.\\nEl 15 de enero de 2018 se dio inicio a las obras de re asfaltado de toda la Avenida, desde Nudo Barón en Valparaíso hasta Puente Capuchinos en  Viña del Mar. Los trabajos duraron varios meses, y fueron la mayor intervención de la Avenida en 40 años.\\n\\n\\n## Referencias \\n\\n## Bibliografía Castagneto, Piero (2010).

When first opened, El Peral was the most advanced funicular due to its structural aspect and for the surrounding complementary buildings.\\n', 'dSop1JRmi76I', 'https://img.icons8.com/?size=150&id=dSop1JRmi76I', '', '#e8fffa', '#8b9996'], ['Museo Maritimo Nacional Chile', 'cultural_site', 'museum', 'Valparaiso', 'Chile', 'https://www.google.com/maps/search/?api=1&query=Museo%20Maritimo%20Nacional%20Chile%20Veintiuno%20de%20Mayo%2045%2C%20Valpara%C3%ADso%2C%20Chile', 'https://citymapper.com/directions?endcoord=-33.0319291,-71.6312352&endname=Museo%20Maritimo%20Nacional%20Chile', '{\"plus_code\":{\"global_code\":\"47RCX999+6G\",\"compound_code\":\"X999+6G Valparaíso, Chile\"},\"place_id\":\"ChIJze0nG9LmiZYRcQ9UHLbYwSw\",\"formatted_address\":\"Veintiuno de Mayo 45, Valparaíso, Chile\",\"geometry\":{\"viewport\":{\"southwest\":{\"lat\":-33.0333413302915,\"lng\":-71.6324756302915},\"northeast\":{\"lat\":-33.0306433697085,\"lng\":-71.62977766970847}},\"location\":{\"lng\":-71.63123519999999,\"lat\":-33.0319291},\"location_type\":\"ROOFTOP\"},\"types\":[\"establishment\",\"museum\",\"point_of_interest\",\"tourist_attraction\"],\"address_components\":[{\"short_name\":\"45\",\"types\":[\"street_number\"],\"long_name\":\"45\"},{\"short_name\":\"Veintiuno de Mayo\",\"long_name\":\"Veintiuno de Mayo\",\"types\":[\"route\"]},{\"long_name\":\"Valparaíso\",\"short_name\":\"Valparaíso\",\"types\":[\"locality\",\"political\"]},{\"types\":[\"administrative_area_level_3\",\"political\"],\"long_name\":\"Valparaíso\",\"short_name\":\"Valparaíso\"},{\"long_name\":\"Valparaiso\",\"short_name\":\"Valparaiso\",\"types\":[\"administrative_area_level_2\",\"political\"]},{\"types\":[\"administrative_area_level_1\",\"political\"],\"long_name\":\"Valparaíso\",\"short_name\":\"Valparaíso\"},{\"long_name\":\"Chile\",\"types\":[\"country\",\"political\"],\"short_name\":\"CL\"}]}', '-33.0319291', '-71.6312352', 'Veintiuno de Mayo', 'Veintiuno de Mayo', 'Veintiuno de Mayo 45, Valparaíso, Chile', 'ROOFTOP', 'ChIJze0nG9LmiZYRcQ9UHLbYwSw', 'museo maritimo nacional chile veintiuno de mayo valparaiso', 'es', 'https://es.wikipedia.org/?curid=49341', 'Valparaíso', '49341', '<span class=\"searchmatch\">Valparaíso</span> es una comuna y ciudad capital <span class=\"searchmatch\">de</span> la provincia y Región <span class=\"searchmatch\">de</span> <span class=\"searchmatch\">Valparaíso</span>.

Su nombre es en honor a su segundo propietario, el empresario croata Pascual Baburizza, que adquirió la mansión en 1925.[1]\\u200b La casona se convirtió en sede del Museo Municipal de Bellas Artes de Valparaíso en 1971 y ocho años más tarde fue declarada Monumento Histórico.\\n\\n\\n## Historia La construcción de la casona la encargó don Ottorino Zanelli (¿? – 1916), un emigrante italiano originario de la provincia de Savona, quien llegó a Chile en la segunda mitad del siglo XIX, acompañado de sus hermanos Julio, Nicolás y Enrique y un primo. Se instalaron primero en la provincia de Tarapacá y se dedicaron al comercio de alimentos y otros productos para abastecer a las pulperías de la zona. En 1882, los cuatro hermanos formaron una sociedad; compraron la oficina salitrera Aguas Blancas, en Antofagasta. Zanelli fue cofundador de la Compañía de Bomberos Pompiere Ausonia de Iquique y se casó en segundas nupcias con la porteña Margarita Morales, con la que tuvo siete hijos: Amalia, Armando, Raúl Luis, Renato, Carlos y Florencio.[2]\\u200b \\nEn 1914, Ottorino Zanelli compró el sitio en el cerro Alegre, donde los arquitectos Barison y Schiavon construyeron su residencia. Sin embargo, Zanelli no alcanzó a disfrutar de la mansión, pues murió el mismo año en que acabaron de levantarla. La viuda vendió en 1925 la casa a don Pascual Baburizza, croata que, como los Zanelli, había llegado al norte de Chile y había hecho fortuna en la zona del salitre.[3]\\u200b\\nBarison y Schiavon se inspiraron en la estética modernista, más específicamente en la corriente del Art Nouveau austriaco, el Jugenstil.[4]\\u200b  Ambos arquitectos habían estudiado primero en la Escuela Industrial de Trieste y luego en Viena. Llegaron a Valparaíso poco después del devastador terremoto de 1906, en un periodo de auge urbanístico y de reconstrucción de la ciudad.\\nLa arquitectura de la casona \"corresponde a las típicas construcciones del centro de Europa y que se encuentran en el norte de Francia, sur de Alemania y en los alrededores de Praga\". Son similares a ella la mansión de Joseph Maria Olbrich en Darmstadt, la casa Tassel del belga Victor Horta en Bruselas, o la villa Majorelle del arquitecto francés Henri Sauvage, en  Nancy.[2]\\u200b \\n\\nCuando compró el palacio, Baburizza le realizó algunas modificaciones importantes. Así, donde había una terraza, agregó un salón, e instaló allí una gran chimenea de mármol. Para decorarla, encargó un gobelino francés con tema de cacería. También agregó un piso, la mansarda, para lo cual elevó el antiguo techo, y coronó la parte más alta de la casona con un torreón. \\nBaburizza escogió al arquitecto Vicente Colovic para realizar las modificaciones estructurales y de los espacios interiores de la casa. Calovic fue asimismo el encargado de construir en 1929 el paseo delante de la mansión; el cual fue donado por el empresario a la ciudad. La Municipalidad le cambió el nombre, de paseo Americano, a Paseo Yugoslavo, en honor a la procedencia de su benefactor.[5]\\u200b\\nEl palacio tiene cerca de dos mil metros construidos repartidos en una planta baja o zócalo, dos pisos con salones y salas de estilo con sobrios artesonados; una mansarda, una amplia escala al segundo piso, ascensor interior y otros espacios, más los jardines y terrazas. El museo lo conforman actualmente la mansión de Baburizza y la de atrás, donde vivía su sobrino. Ambas construcciones están unidas por un patio interior en el primer nivel, y por un puente vidriado en el segundo. Esta segunda casa habitación tenía acceso por la calle Montealegre, el cual hoy no se utiliza. Además cuenta con un salón y una espléndida chimenea, en estilo art déco. Exteriormente, la fachada de ambas edificaciones es continua y no se aprecian diferencias entre ambas. \\n\\nDe la imponente puerta principal de madera destacan los adornos de metal y las dos columnas que la escoltan. El edificio adjunto tiene relieves, capiteles, ventanas de madera, decoraciones de hierro y diversas figuras. Los decorados en forma de espirales tanto en muros como en rejas, recuerdan el estilo del pintor Gustav Klimt; y los decorados, a la villa del pintor bávaro Franz von Stuck. Los bajo relieves contienen formas y figuras enigmáticas como los triángulos dentro de triángulos en las canaletas de agua.[6]\\u200b\\nLos artesonados de los techos de los salones principales son valiosos, así como la marquetería de los zócalos y el diseño de las chimeneas. Una de ellas es de mármol veteado y está enmarcada por un gran gobelino francés; hay otra sencilla en el salón contiguo y dos de revestimientos en madera y cerámicos, que originalmente se alimentaban con gas. Una de estas se encuentra en el hall de los salones interiores, de estilo art déco.\\n\\nSon destacables las dos puertas de rejas, una en la pasada del primer piso, y otra antes del que era el dormitorio de Baburizza. En el segundo piso se ubica un mirador saliente de esquina que permite una vista hacia el paseo, la plaza y la calle Montealegre, algo común en la arquitectura alemana y austriaca.\\nEn el exterior destacan los grandes faroles en fierro forjado y toda la cerrajería, herrería y enrejados que fueron realizados en los talleres de Alejandro Santambrogio; así como los yesos, mármoles y relieves escultóricos de Carmelo Faggioni. Los zócalos, la puerta principal y otros ornamentos son ricos en maderas nobles, provenientes de la Fábrica de Muebles Artísticos de Félix Mazzoni. Todo se armoniza con los juegos de aleros, salientes y vanos, terminados en una techumbre de cobre envejecido. \\nLos salones patrimoniales del primer piso conservan su aspecto original —con elementos museográficos indispensables, como iluminación, cámaras de vigilancia, alarmas, sistemas contra incendios, filtros en ventanas y persianas—, pero las demás dependencias han sido adaptadas para su función de museo. Se ha rehabilitado el antiguo ascensor interior de la casa y agregado uno nuevo desde el acceso a la extensión. \\n\\n \\nLa municipalidad compró en 1971 el palacio a los herederos del empresario croata y lo convirtió en sede del citado museo. Veinticinco años después, este cerró debido a su deterioro. El edificio pasó diversas etapas de restauración. \\nEn agosto de 2008, el Programa de Recuperación y Desarrollo Urbano de Valparaíso (PRDUV), que depende de la Subsecretaría de Desarrollo Regional y Administrativo, terminó la primera fase de recuperación, que contempló la estabilización del torreón. En una segunda etapa, realizada entre diciembre del 2009 y febrero del 2010, se repararon los daños causados por la humedad, tratamiento fitosanitario y obras de seguridad del sistema eléctrico y de la red de agua.[7]\\u200b \\nLa última fase de restauración se realizó de acuerdo un proyecto coordinado por el arquitecto Mario Pérez de Arce. Finalmente, el palacio fue reinaugurado por el presidente Sebastián Piñera, el 27 de septiembre de 2012.\\nEl inmueble fue declarado Monumento Histórico por el decreto 1876, de 19 de julio de 1979.\\nDon Pascual Baburizza fue coleccionista de arte, y legó sus cuadros a Valparaíso; ellos pasaron a integrar los fondos del Museo Municipal de Bellas Artes y hoy constituyen la Colección Europea, que se exhibe en el primer piso.\\n\\n\\n## Galería \\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n## Véase también Museo Municipal de Bellas Artes de Valparaíso\\nPascual Baburizza\\nPalacios de Valparaíso\\nPalacio Valle\\n\\n\\n## Referencias ==', 'lAwJ42xa0VsG', 'https://img.icons8.com/?size=150&id=lAwJ42xa0VsG', '', '#fffde8', '#99978b'], ['Ascensor Concepcion', 'tour', 'funicular', 'Valparaiso', 'Chile', 'https://www.google.com/maps/search/?api=1&query=Ascensor%20Concepcion%20932%20-%20Esmeralda%20916%2C%202363253%20Valpara%C3%ADso%2C%20Chile', 'https://citymapper.com/directions?endcoord=-33.0407669,-71.6264097&endname=Ascensor%20Concepcion', '{\"place_id\":\"ChIJodp0AyzhiZYRJe2tBjEkMpk\",\"formatted_address\":\"932 - Esmeralda 916, 2363253 Valparaíso, Chile\",\"plus_code\":{\"compound_code\":\"X95F+MC Valparaíso, Chile\",\"global_code\":\"47RCX95F+MC\"},\"geometry\":{\"location_type\":\"ROOFTOP\",\"location\":{\"lat\":-33.0407669,\"lng\":-71.6264097},\"viewport\":{\"southwest\":{\"lng\":-71.62770668029151,\"lat\":-33.0420821302915},\"northeast\":{\"lat\":-33.0393841697085,\"lng\":-71.6250087197085}}},\"address_components\":[{\"types\":[\"street_number\"],\"short_name\":\"916\",\"long_name\":\"916\"},{\"long_name\":\"Esmeralda\",\"short_name\":\"Esmeralda\",\"types\":[\"route\"]},{\"short_name\":\"Valparaíso\",\"types\":[\"locality\",\"political\"],\"long_name\":\"Valparaíso\"},{\"short_name\":\"Valparaíso\",\"types\":[\"administrative_area_level_3\",\"political\"],\"long_name\":\"Valparaíso\"},{\"types\":[\"administrative_area_level_2\",\"political\"],\"short_name\":\"Valparaiso\",\"long_name\":\"Valparaiso\"},{\"types\":[\"administrative_area_level_1\",\"political\"],\"long_name\":\"Valparaíso\",\"short_name\":\"Valparaíso\"},{\"short_name\":\"CL\",\"long_name\":\"Chile\",\"types\":[\"country\",\"political\"]},{\"short_name\":\"2363253\",\"long_name\":\"2363253\",\"types\":[\"postal_code\"]}],\"types\":[\"establishment\",\"point_of_interest\",\"tourist_attraction\"]}', '-33.0407669', '-71.6264097', 'Esmeralda', 'Esmeralda', '932 - Esmeralda 916, 2363253 Valparaíso, Chile', 'ROOFTOP', 'ChIJodp0AyzhiZYRJe2tBjEkMpk', 'ascensor concepcion esmeralda valparaiso chile', 'es', 'https://es.wikipedia.org/?curid=49341', 'Valparaíso', '49341', '<span class=\"searchmatch\">Valparaíso</span> es una comuna y ciudad capital de la provincia y Región de <span class=\"searchmatch\">Valparaíso</span>.

Designed in 1907 by the French Architect Louis Dubois, a graduate of the École des Beaux-Arts in Paris, the 70-room hotel is one of the most prominent surviving local examples of the French Art Nouveau style.\\n\\n\\n## History It was designed by architect Louis Dubois in 1904 and opened in 1906 originally called Lutetia Hotel, and was one of the greatest representatives of Art Nouveau arrived in Argentina in the early twentieth century. The Avenida de Mayo was still a fashionable avenue, opened in 1896, where during the passage of the first decade of the styles used for buildings evolved, from academicism or Neoclassicism to Art Nouveau, Art Deco and later.\\nMoreover Avenue, which had been designed for residences of the aristocracy and great palaces, was exploited by the owners of the land to build apartment buildings there income (rent) which quickly mutated into hotels. At that historical moment was constructed Hotel Lutetia.\\nHe later became National Hotel. In 1938, it changed hands and became Chile Hotel Romanelli, still owned by the hotelier Romanelli. Sunday May Avenue fell into decay over the decades and the shift of focus of the company to other sectors driven by its transformation into the artery leading political and social situations in the country. When connecting the Palace of Congress with the House of Government, political demonstrations and marches focused mainly on it.\\nThe worst Hotel Chile disaster occurred on August 4, 1988, when a fire broke out at 0:30 am on the 4th floor, 2 extending to the attic (5th floor) and the dome, and totally consuming them within two hours. Also the front of the building was seriously damaged, large pieces of masonry falling into the street. The hotel was restored, replacing the slate mansard corrugated iron, without recovering his famous dome, and received through a facade. The neighboring building on Avenida de Mayo, designed by architect Dubois, was also affected by the incident, and had to be completely reworked then also lost its cupola bay window and run adorning its facade.\\nOn the ground floor of the Hotel Chile, accessed through the facet, worked for years the Spanish restaurant Spain Square, one of several that specialize in traditional cuisine in this section of the Avenida de Mayo, artery historically adopted by the Spanish to their meetings and trade since the early twentieth century.\\n', 'oSXnsjjZF3Uk', 'https://img.icons8.com/?size=150&id=oSXnsjjZF3Uk', '', '#f2e8ff', '#918b99'], ['GRU Airport', 'waypoint', 'airport', 'São Paulo', 'Brazil', 'https://www.google.com/maps/search/?api=1&query=GRU%20Airport%20S%C3%A3o%20Paulo-Guarulhos%20Int%27l%20Airport%20%28GRU%29%20-%20Rod.%20H%C3%A9lio%20Smidt%2C%20s%2Fn%C2%BA%20-%20Aeroporto%2C%20Guarulhos%20-%20SP%2C%2007190-100%2C%20Brazil', 'https://citymapper.com/directions?endcoord=-23.4302175,-46.4716711&endname=GRU%20Airport', '{\"address_components\":[{\"types\":[\"airport\",\"establishment\",\"point_of_interest\"],\"long_name\":\"São Paulo-Guarulhos International Airport\",\"short_name\":\"São Paulo-Guarulhos Int\\'l Airport\"},{\"long_name\":\"s/nº\",\"short_name\":\"s/nº\",\"types\":[\"street_number\"]},{\"short_name\":\"Rod.

It is popularly known locally as either Cumbica Airport, after the district where it is located and the Brazilian Air Force base that exists at the airport complex, or Guarulhos Airport, after the municipality of Guarulhos, in the state of São Paulo, where it is located. Since November 28, 2001, the airport has been named after André Franco Montoro (1916–1999), former Governor of São Paulo state. The airport was rebranded as GRU Airport in 2012.\\nThe airport was the busiest in Brazil in terms of transported passengers, aircraft operations, and cargo handled in 2012, placing it as the second busiest airport in Latin America by passenger traffic (41.307.915 2023) after Mexico City International Airport. Guarulhos has slot restrictions, operating with a maximum of 45 operations/hour and being one of the five airports with such restrictions in Brazil (the others are São Paulo-Congonhas, Brasília, Belo Horizonte-Pampulha and Rio de Janeiro-Santos Dumont).\\nSince 2012, the airport has been operated by a consortium composed of Invepar S/A, Airports Company South Africa, and Infraero.\\nSome of its facilities are shared with the São Paulo Air Force Base of the Brazilian Air Force.\\n\\n\\n## History \\nOn June 6, 1967, in response to the growth of air traffic in Brazil, the Brazilian military government initiated studies concerning the renovation of the airport infrastructure in Brazil. As part of the conclusions of these studies, because of their location, strategic importance, and security issues, new passenger facilities would be constructed in the areas of Galeão Air Force Base in Rio de Janeiro and São Paulo Air Force Base in São Paulo.\\nIn relation to São Paulo, the initial planning of the airport involved three runways and four passenger terminals. However, the first phase of the construction comprising two runways and two terminals started only on August 11, 1980. The airport was officially inaugurated on January 20, 1985. Quickly Guarulhos became the city\\'s primary airport, supplanting São Paulo–Congonhas Airport.\\nIn 1989 the runways were extended and the terminals renovated, enlarged, and had their capacity increased from 7.5 million to 8.25 million passengers/year. The whole complex covered 13.86 square kilometres (3,425 acres), of which 5 square kilometres (1,200 acres) is urbanised area.\\nConstruction of Terminal 3, capable of handling 12 million passengers per year, had been planned since 2001 but due to a myriad of political and economic problems, the actual construction didn\\'t begin until 2011.\\nIn 2010, the airport served more than 26.8 million passengers, an increase of 24% over 2009 and passenger volumes were 31% in excess of its capacity rated at 20.5 million per year at its present configuration.\\nIn order to relieve the acute overcrowding at Terminals 1 and 2, Infraero announced on May 17, 2011 that the former cargo terminals of defunct airlines VASP and Transbrasil, later used by Federal Agencies, would undergo renovations and adaptations for use as domestic passenger terminals with remote boarding. This new terminal was initially called Terminal 4 (T4). The first phase of the renovations, comprising the former VASP terminal, opened on February 8, 2012, and the second phase, comprising the former Transbrasil terminal, was opened in June 2013. Contrary to what had been announced before, the new terminal will be permanent. Webjet was the first airline to use the new facility. The new terminal, in its first phase, increased the capacity of the airport in 5.5 million passengers/year and, in the second phase to 8 million passengers/year. In total, Guarulhos would then be able to handle 28.5 million passengers/year.\\nResponding to critiques to the situation of its airports, on May 18, 2011, Infraero released a list evaluating some of its most important airports according to its saturation levels. According to the list, Guarulhos was considered to be critically saturated, operating above 85% of its capacity.\\nFollowing a decision made on April 26, 2011 by the Federal Government for private companies being granted concessions to explore some Infraero airports, on February 6, 2012, the administration of the airport was conceded, for 20 years, to the Consortium Invepar–ACSA, also known as GRU Airport, composed by the Brazilian Invepar, an Investments and Funds Society (90%) and the South African ACSA–Airports Company South Africa (10%). Infraero, the state-run organisation, remains with 49% of the shares of the company incorporated for the administration.\\nOn December 2, 2015, the airport\\'s terminals were renumbered. Former Terminal 4 was renumbered Terminal 1; former terminals 1 and 2, which were wings of a single building, became the new Terminal 2. Terminal 3 kept its numbering. The new numbering reflects the order by which terminals are reached when one arrives at the airport by the access road, and is expected to be less confusing in the long term. Check-in counters and gates were also renumbered, with the first digit being now the new terminal number.\\nOn October 28, 2015, the National Civil Aviation Agency of Brazil (Anac) authorised Airbus A380 operations at Guarulhos Airport, effective four days later. The authorisation was granted after extensive works were conducted on the runways and taxiways (including widening runway 09L/27R to 60 metres (196 ft 10 in)) and special taxiing procedures were established. On November 14, 2015, Emirates operated a one-time special flight with the A380 on its Dubai-São Paulo route to commemorate its eight years of operations in Brazil.\\nOn March 26, 2017, Emirates started daily A380 service from Dubai to São Paulo, replacing the Boeing 777-300ER previously used on that route – coincidentally, on the same day that the other UAE airline, Etihad, ended its services to São Paulo.\\n\\n\\n## Facilities \\n## Runways and taxiways =GRU has two parallel runways. Runway 10R/28L is 3,000 metres (9,843 ft) long and 45 metres (148 ft) wide, while runway 10L/28R is 3,700 metres (12,140 ft) long and 60 metres (200 ft) wide, after being widened in 2015 to better receive the Airbus A380. The field elevation at the airport is 750 metres (2,459 ft) above mean sea level. Runway 10R/28L is mostly used for landings and runway 10L/28R for takeoffs. There are high-speed exit taxiways on both runways that allow for traffic to depart the runway at higher speed to allow better efficiency for landing and takeoff traffic. As of 2014, there was an average of 650 takeoff and landing operations per day at the airport.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n## Terminals =The airport has three passenger terminals, numbered 1, 2, and 3, according to their order along the airport access road when arriving from the city.\\n\\nTerminal 1 is the smallest and simplest. It has only domestic flights, and as of January 2020, only Azul operates there, as former Passaredo (now VoePass) has been moved to Terminal 2. Terminal 1 has no jet bridges and no direct access to the other terminals, which can only be reached by a free shuttle bus.\\nTerminal 2 is the oldest and largest, and for many years was the sole airport terminal, although its two wings were considered different terminals at the time. It has the majority of domestic flights and to Latin American destinations, as well as a few intercontinental flights.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nTerminal 3 is the newest and most modern. It has only international flights and concentrates most long-haul intercontinental traffic, in addition to the LATAM Group\\'s Latin American flights. Five of the terminal\\'s gates can accommodate the Airbus A380.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nTerminals 2 and 3 are directly linked by a walkway.\\nThe airport also has a large air cargo terminal with a built area of 97,000 square metres (1,040,000 sq ft) and is capable of handling any type of cargo, including refrigerated and hazardous shipments.\\n\\n## Navigational aids =There are two navigational aids that GRU traffic uses. The Bonsucesso very high frequency omnidirectional range with distance measuring equipment (VOR-DME) is located 9.1 kilometres; 5.6 miles (4.9 nmi) to the east of GRU.\\n\\n\\n## Developments In 2009 Infraero unveiled a R$ 1,489.5 million (US$784.7 USD million; €549.8 EUR million) investment plan to upgrade Guarulhos International Airport, focusing on preparations for the 2014 FIFA World Cup and the Summer Olympics in 2016. The investment was supposed to be used as follows:\\n\\nConstruction of additional taxiways. Cost: R$ 19M. Completion: April 2016.\\nEnlargement of apron and taxiways. Cost: R$370,5M. Completion: May 2016.\\nConstruction of passenger Terminal 3. Cost: R$1,100M. Completed: March 2014. Opened for Star Alliance airlines in May.\\nCentral to this investment plan was Terminal 3, which is projected to add 12 million passenger capacity to the 17 million of the existing two terminals. Plans for a third runway were decided to be \"technically impracticable\" and were cancelled in January 2008.\\nHowever, the former concessionary, Infraero, experienced many legal and bureaucratic difficulties, which prevented most (if any) of these improvements from being completed on schedule. As of April 2013, the new concessionary unveiled a new expansion project, which included the new Terminal 3 (with a different design than the one proposed by Infraero), the widening of the main runway in order to enable operations by the large Airbus A380 and Boeing 747-8, operated by Emirates and Lufthansa respectively, and several other improvements in the existing terminals and parking area.\\nTerminal 3 is open and all Star Alliance airlines are in, as well as many other overseas carriers. International flights by LATAM also use the facility.\\nA train service development and construction has also been planned, however never concluded and cancelled. This included an Airport Express Line linking the airport to downtown São Paulo and a Rio–São Paulo high-speed rail connecting Guarulhos to Rio de Janeiro-Galeão and Campinas-Viracopos airports.\\nSince March 2017 American Airlines invested US$ 100 million on a 17,000 m2 (180,000 sq ft) maintenance hangar at Guarulhos Airport, building together with the LATAM Hangar of R$ 130 million. The American Airlines one is capable of performing line maintenance on two wide-body aircraft at the same time, of the types commonly used by the U.S. company on routes between São Paulo and the United States and the LATAM one is capable of performing line maintenance of one wide-body aircraft. It could also be used by other companies as storage for parts. The same conditions applies to the LATAM maintenance center.\\n\\n\\n## Airlines and destinations \\n## Passenger Note:\\na: Flights operated with Voepass equipment on behalf of LATAM Brasil.\\nb: Flights temporarily being operated to Canoas Air Force Base.\\n\\n## Cargo \\n## Statistics \\nFollowing is the number of passenger, aircraft and cargo movements at the airport, according to Infraero (2007-2012) and GRU Airport (2013-2023) reports:\\n\\n\\n## Accidents and incidents On January 28, 1986, a VASP Boeing 737-2A1 registered PP-SME flying from Guarulhos to Belo Horizonte unknowingly tried to take-off from Guarulhos, during foggy conditions, from a taxiway. The take-off was aborted, but the aircraft overran, collided with a dyke and broke in two. One passenger died.\\nOn March 21, 1989, a Transbrasil cargo Boeing 707-349C registered PT-TCS operating flight 801, flying from Manaus to São Paulo-Guarulhos, crashed at the district of Vila Barros in Guarulhos, shortly before touch-down at runway 09R. That day, at 12:00, the runway was going to be closed for maintenance and the crew decided to speed up procedures to touch-down before closure (it was already 11:54). In a hurry, one of the crew members, by mistake, activated the air-dynamic brakes, and the aircraft lost too much speed to have enough aerodynamic support (resulting in a stall). As a consequence the aircraft crashed approximately 2 kilometres (1.2 mi) from the airport. There were 25 fatalities, of which three were crew members and 22 were civilians on the ground. As well as the 22 fatalities, there were over 200 injured on the ground.\\nOn March 2, 1996, a Madrid Táxi Aéreo Gates Learjet 25D registered PT-LSD transporting the Brazilian band Mamonas Assassinas crashed into Cantareira mountain range, located north of the airport, at 23:16 local time killing all 9 passengers on board. The aircraft was on final approach to land on the runway 09R, but went around. As it flew toward the runway for a second attempt to land, the ATC instructed the pilots to make a right turn heading south, but they turned north (left) and crashed into the mountain range at 3,300 feet (1,000 m), 10.0 kilometres (6.2 mi) from the airport. Ironically, all band members were from a Guarulhos neighborhood located close to the airport.\\nOn September 14, 2002, a Total Linhas Aéreas ATR42-312 registered PT-MTS on a cargo flight between São Paulo-Guarulhos and Londrina crashed while en route near Paranapanema. The crew of 2 died.\\n\\n\\n## Access The airport is located 25 km (16 mi) from downtown São Paulo.\\n\\n## Car =The airport has its own highway system: Rodovia Hélio Smidt Highway which connects the airport to Presidente Dutra Highway or Ayrton Senna Highway. Residents of Guarulhos can access the road via Monteiro Lobato Avenue. Taxi stands are located outside each of the two terminals on the Arrivals level; inside there are car rental agency representatives.\\n\\n## Bus =Bus transportation is available through the Airport Bus Service, an executive bus line, administered by EMTU and operated by Consórcio Internorte – Área 3. This service provides transportation connecting Guarulhos to Congonhas airport; to Tietê Bus Terminal; to Palmeiras-Barra Funda Intermodal Terminal, to Faria Lima Ave; To Republica Square (Praça da República); To Berrini Ave., Itaim Bibi district; and to the circuit of hotels along Paulista Avenue and Rua Augusta. The ride takes about one hour, depending on traffic. At the airport, tickets can be purchased at the counter located outside the lounge of the Terminal 1, Wing B\\'s arrivals level.\\nPássaro Marron/EMTU, a syndicate of the Internorte Consortium, offers two regular bus lines, 257 and 299, connecting Tatuapé subway station (Line 3-Red) with Guarulhos Airport every 30 minutes. At Tatuapé, both buses can be picked up on a platform of that multimodal station\\'s North side bus terminal. At the airport, the stop for both buses is at the Arrivals level road connecting the wings of Terminal 2.\\nGol Airlines and LATAM offer for their passengers free bus transfers between Guarulhos and Congonhas airports at regular times.\\nViação Cometa offers daily departures to and from the airport and the cities of Santos, Sorocaba, São Vicente, and Praia Grande. Lirabus operates daily buses between the airport and Campinas. Pássaro Marron offers bus services to São José dos Campos with departures every two hours. Viação Transdutra connects the airport with the city of Arujá.\\n\\n## Rail Line 13-Jade of the São Paulo commuter rail system, operated by CPTM, connects with the airport through Aeroporto-Guarulhos Station. This line started its operations experimentally on March 31, 2018. The line was opened initially on a trial phase and operates only on Saturdays and Sundays from 10 a.m. to 3 p.m., with trains every 30 minutes to the suburban station of Engenheiro Goulart in eastern São Paulo city, from where a further connection with CPTM\\'s line 12 and at least another one by subway will be necessary to reach downtown and the main business areas. Service will be expanded in May 2018 to seven days a week, but still only from 10 a.m. to 3 p.m. Full service from 4 a.m. to midnight is expected in late June 2018.\\n\\nAdditionally, since December 2020 there\\'s the Airport Express service, from Luz station to Aeroporto-Guarulhos, departing from each termini station every hour. It attends only one station towards Aeroporto-Guarulhos (Guarulhos-CECAP station), and 2 stations towards Luz (Guarulhos-CECAP and Brás).\\nAeroporto-Guarulhos station is opposite to Terminal 1, which is Guarulhos Airport\\'s smallest and least busy, and not linked to the other terminals except by a shuttle bus. The GRU Airport company reportedly vetoed a station closer to much busier Terminals 2 and 3 because it intended to build a shopping mall at the proposed location. The excessive number of train changes through crowded commuter rail and subway lines, and the added inconvenience of the requirement for a shuttle bus, has attracted criticism to the São Paulo state government, responsible for São Paulo\\'s subway and commuter rail systems, which has been accused of flawed planning and overindulgence with the airport\\'s private concessionaire.\\nTo solve this situation, Governor João Doria and State Secretary of Metropolitan Transports Alexandre Baldy proposed a people mover to connect the CPTM station directly to the airport, estimated to be opened in May 2021. However, many delays prevented the construction of the line, which should be owned and fully operated by GRU Airport. In November 2020, the Brazilian federal government, through the Ministry of Infrastructure, authorized the construction of the people mover, which should cost R$ 175 million (approximately US$ 47.7 million in 2019).\\nIn December 2020 it was announced that Brazilian firm Aerom, which owns the Aeromovel technology, had been selected to install the system.  Construction was due to begin in January 2021 with completing in 2022.  In June 2021 it was announced that the project had \\'advanced\\' but a schedule for construction had not been finalised.\\n', 'dOcutZ26h8RF', 'https://img.icons8.com/?size=150&id=dOcutZ26h8RF', '', '#f2e8ff', '#918b99'], ['SCL Airport', 'waypoint', 'airport', 'Arturo Merino Benítez International Airport', 'Chile', 'https://www.google.com/maps/search/?api=1&query=SCL%20Airport%20Arturo%20Merino%20Benitez%20International%20Airport%20-%20Av.%20Armando%20Cort%C3%ADnez%20Ote.%201704%2C%20Pudahuel%2C%20Regi%C3%B3n%20Metropolitana%2C%20Chile', 'https://citymapper.com/directions?endcoord=-33.3972639,-70.7937376&endname=SCL%20Airport', '{\"place_id\":\"ChIJO2DomMbBYpYR5amfsYHN8V8\",\"geometry\":{\"location\":{\"lng\":-70.7937376,\"lat\":-33.3972639},\"location_type\":\"ROOFTOP\",\"viewport\":{\"northeast\":{\"lng\":-70.7923909197085,\"lat\":-33.39588656970849},\"southwest\":{\"lat\":-33.39858453029149,\"lng\":-70.79508888029152}}},\"types\":[\"airport\",\"establishment\",\"point_of_interest\"],\"formatted_address\":\"Arturo Merino Benitez International Airport - Av.

In 2011, it was the ninth busiest airport in Latin America and the sixth busiest in South America by passenger traffic. It was the seventh busiest airport in Latin America by aircraft movements, serving 124,799 operations. Its location in Chile\\'s most populated area, as well as in the central part of the country, makes it an ideal main hub and maintenance center for most local airlines such as LATAM and Sky Airline. LATAM Airlines accounts for approximately 82% of the airport\\'s total commercial operations.\\nThe airport is owned by the Chilean government and has been operated since October 2015 by Nuevo Pudahuel, a consortium of companies formed by Aéroports de Paris (France), Vinci Airports (France) and Astaldi (Italy). Air traffic control is handled by the Directorate General of Civil Aviation. Its ICAO category is 4F. The airport functions as a joint civil-military facility. It is the headquarters of the Chilean Air Force 2nd Air Brigade and where its 10th Aviation Group is based.\\nSantiago International is the longest non-stop destination for most European carriers including Iberia, Air France, and British Airways from their respective hubs in Madrid–Barajas Airport, Paris–Charles de Gaulle, and London–Heathrow Airport. The airport is also Latin America\\'s main gateway to Oceania, with scheduled flights to Sydney, Melbourne, Auckland, and Easter Island.\\n\\n\\n## History \\n## Early years The demands of the growing metropolitan area of Santiago and the need for modern, jet-era airport facilities, which could safely accommodate both domestic and intercontinental flights, drove the need to relocate the Chilean capital\\'s principal airport from Los Cerrillos Airport (ICAO: SCTI; IATA: ULC) in the denser southwest metropolitan region of Santiago to the more rural northwest metropolitan area.\\nConstruction of the original terminal building, the eastern runway (17L/35R), control tower, east apron and cargo facilities commenced in 1961. On February 2, 1967, the airport was commissioned Aeropuerto Internacional de Pudahuel, due to its location in the municipality of Pudahuel. On March 19, 1980, the airport was rechristened Arturo Merino Benítez International Airport in honour of the founder of the Chilean Air Force and Chilean carrier LATAM Chile (Formerly Linea Aerea Nacional, LAN Chile).\\n\\n## 1994 expansion =The facility was expanded in 1994 with a new international terminal that covered 90,000 square meters, inspired by the architecture of Marseille Provence Airport in France. The building is located between the two parallel runways.\\nThis expansion added a new control tower, jetways, a duty-free zone, hotel, and greater parking area. The old terminal was used for domestic flights until 2001, when all passenger operations were merged into the same building.\\nIn 2000, Lan Chile joined Oneworld, making of Arturo Merino Benitez Airport a main hub for the alliance, its first one in Latin America and its second in the Southern Hemisphere (after Qantas\\' Sydney Kingsford Smith International Airport in Australia). As of April 2014, 71% of international and 75% of domestic passengers were carried by Oneworld member airlines.\\nDuring the 2010 Chile earthquake, the passenger terminal building suffered internal damages and the collapse of a pedestrian bridge between the vehicle ramp and the departures area. Nevertheless, both runways and control tower were unharmed, allowing the realization of a massive humanitarian air-bridge held by the Chilean Air Force to Concepción, Chile (Carriel Sur International Airport), close to the most damaged area by this earthquake and subsequent tsunami. The airport authority had closed off all commercial flight operations after around 1200 UTC on February 27, resuming full operations on March 3, 2010.\\nIn 2011, IATA recognized the DGAC (Chile\\'s provider of air navigation services) and SCL (Santiago Airport) with the Exceptional Recognition Award to the cooperative efforts of SCL and DGAC Chile that facilitated a quick recovery from the devastation that followed the Chilean earthquake on 27 February 2010. \"Both airport and air navigation services were restored quickly with no impact on rates or charges for passengers or airlines. DGAC Chile and SCL are widely regarded as leaders in Latin America for efficiency, quality, and customer focus.\\n\\nIn June 2011, Santiago International Airport received the Air Cargo Excellence Award, as the best Latin American Cargo Airport.\\n\\n## Second runway =Construction on Runway 17R/35L began in 2004 and opened to traffic in September 2005. However, within months defects were discovered and the runway required repairing, completed in January 2006. Unfortunately further study of the problem discovered that the initial repairs were insufficient, needing additional work. Finally, 17R/35L reopened for traffic in March 2007.\\n\\n## 2020 master plan and expansion =In 2008, the airport terminal reached its maximum design capacity of 9.5 million annual passengers, two years earlier than forecast, and with the repairs needed after the 2010 Chile earthquake, the Ministry of Public Works announced in 2012 that it would call for proposals for the expansion and administration of the airport, two years prior to the end of the contract with the current operator.\\nThe ministry decided to investigate a new airport master plan instead of an expansion of the single passenger terminal building, as initially proposed by the current operator. The feasibility studies for this master plan cost 4,560 million Chilean pesos (US$9.4 million) considered in the 2011 fiscal budget.\\nFor this new master plan, the Government hired the consultancy services of Aéroports de Paris Ingeniérie (ADP-I), the architecture, engineering and technical branch of the French airport corporation.\\nThe master plan took into account a capacity growth to 14 million annual passengers by 2014, thirty-four million by year 2034 and 50 million passengers by 2045. New detached passenger terminal buildings for international and domestic flights, additional commercial areas and the construction of a light railway connecting the airport with the Santiago Metro network were considered.\\nIn June 2013, the Chilean Ministry of Public Works started Phase 1 of the airport expansion.\\nOn February 4, 2015, the consortium \"Nuevo Pudahuel\", formed by French companies Aéroports de Paris (45%), Vinci Airports (40%) and Italian infrastructure company Astaldi (15%) won the bidding process to manage and develop the airport for 20 years since October 1, 2015. The main missions of the new administration will be \"the renovation of existing installations with the redesign and extension of the current terminal; the funding, design and construction of a new 175,000-square-meter terminal which will increase the airport\\'s capacity to 30 million passengers, with potential for expansion beyond 45 million; the operation and commercial development for the duration of the concession (20 years) of the main infrastructures: existing terminal and new terminals, car parks and future property developments. Building works will be executed by Astaldi (50% of conception-construction pool) and Vinci Construction Grands Projets (50%)\".\\n\\n\\n## Facilities \\n## Terminal 1 – domestic flights The terminal building, originally built for both domestic and international operations until 2021, has four levels:\\n\\nGround floor: Arrivals, duty-free shop, baggage claim, transport services, parking areas, hotel access.\\nFirst floor: Administrative offices, VIP lounges (access through the second floor).\\nSecond floor: Departures, check-in & baggage drop off hall, shops, restaurants, boarding gates.\\nThird floor: Restaurants and VIP check-in areas (LATAM).\\nTerminal 1 hosts a bank office, Chilean Automobile Club, telecommunication companies (Claro, Movistar and Entel PCS), pharmacy, travel agencies, airlines offices, insurance offices and a police station (Carabineros de Chile).\\n\\n## Terminal 2 – international flights =The new international terminal covers more than 200,000 square meters. It involved an investment of $900 million USD. Construction started in August 2016 and ended in March 2021, increasing the total airport capacity from 16 to 30 million passengers per year.\\nThe core of the new terminal consists of a central processor (T2M) where passengers undertake arrivals and departures procedures as well as four piers where the departure lounges are located.\\n\\n## Terminal 2 piers =## Pier C ==Pier C is a structure that has 10 boarding bridges, on a surface of more than 23,700 square metres of serviceable area, and 27,600 square metres of constructed area. It opened its doors in December 2018. Its internal design and green colour are inspired by Easter Island (Rapa Nui).\\nThe pier has more than 1,900 square metres dedicated to retail space, of which 250 square metres are allocated to Duty Free areas. The structure also has PRM assistance zones.\\n\\n## Pier D ==Pier D features 10 loading bridges covering an area of over 22,000 square meters and opened its doors in July 2021. Passengers are able to reach Pier D directly from the \"Main Unit\" (T2M) and it is a place for both domestic and international flights. The building also features commercial and gastronomic premises, a playground, an area for art and culture and aid stations for passengers with reduced mobility. The space is inspired by the Atacama region, mirrored in its range of warm colors and panels inspired by the light, energy and strength of northern Chile.\\n\\n## Pier E ==Pier E has 12 passenger boarding bridges on a surface of more than 26,700 square metres and opened during the second half of 2019. \\nThe pier has more than 1,600 square metres dedicated to retail space, of which 250 square metres are allocated to Duty Free areas. The structure will also have PRM assistance zones. It has been inspired by the region of Los Lagos (Lake District), and this is reflected in the structure\\'s blue palette and decorative panels.\\n\\n## Pier F ==Pier F has 10 loading bridges in an area of over 21,000 square meters and was opened in July 2021. Passengers reach pier F directly from the \"Main Unit\" (T2M) and it is entirely used for international flights. The building also features commercial and gastronomic premises, a playground, an art and culture area and aid stations for passengers with reduced mobility. The space is based on Patagonia, mirrored in its range of cold colors and panels inspired by the freshness, cleanliness and calm of southern Chile.\\n\\n## Airline lounges =In the international terminal, the operators are:\\n\\nLATAM Airlines Signature Lounge: Access for LATAM\\'s Premium Business Class travellers, and LATAM Pass Black and Black Signature frequent flyers.\\nLATAM Airlines Premium Lounge: Access for LATAM\\'s Premium Economy Class travellers, and LATAM Pass Platinum frequent flyers.\\nLATAM Airlines WorldMember Lounge: Access for Santander WorldMember or WorldMember Limited cardholders traveling in a LATAM-operated flight.\\nSkyTeam Lounge: Access for SkyTeam alliance Premium cabin passengers and SkyTeam Elite Plus tier status members.\\nPrimeClass Pacifico - one lounge per concourse, following the concourse’s respective themes (Priority Pass, partner airlines and other banks such as Banco de Chile)\\nPacific Club - Concourse C (Priority Pass)\\n\\n## Hotels =Holiday Inn Hotels finished the construction of a five-floor building in July 2007, internally connected to both terminals (international and domestic). The hotel has 112 rooms, restaurants, bars, room-service, a conference hall for 170 people, gym, covered swimming pool, spa and wi-fi internet access.\\nHotel Diego de Almagro is located 2 km outside the airport area.\\nThe Hilton Garden Inn Santiago Airport Hotel is located 2.8 km from the Santiago International Airport within the ENEA, one of the largest business complexes in Santiago de Chile which hosts offices, industry and entertainment. The hotel has 144 rooms, a fitness center, indoor swimming pool, sauna, seven meeting spaces including a ballroom and business center.\\nThe LQ Hotel Santiago Airport (La Quinta Inns & Suites) is under construction and will be the newest hotel near the airport and the first LQ Hotel in Chile. The hotel is located 2.8 km from Santiago International Airport. The hotel will have a restaurant, indoor swimming pool, fitness center, wifi, business center and meeting space.\\n\\n## Maintenance facilities =American Airlines operates a widebody aircraft maintenance facility at the airport, opened in November 2018. The facility holds maintenance hangars, a classroom, offices, parts storage, and tarmac space for two Boeing 777s/787s.  \\n\\n\\n## Military functions The airport is the headquarters of the Chilean Air Force II Air Brigade and hosts the 10th Aviation Group facilities. The 10th Aviation Group provides Strategic Air Transportation, air transportation of the President of Chile, emergency medical air transport, and supervises the Airborne Early Warning & Control Squadron. Some of its units are C-130 Hercules, Boeing 767-300, Boeing 737 Classic, Gulfstream IV, CASA C-212 Aviocar, F-16 Fighting Falcon, AEW&C Condor and Boeing E-3 Sentry.\\nThe FIDAE (Feria Internacional del Aire y del Espacio), Latin America\\'s most important air show, takes place in the 10th Aviation Group facilities.\\n\\n\\n## Airlines and destinations \\n## Passenger =\\n## Cargo \\n## Statistics \\n l\\n\\n\\n## Ground transportation \\n## Roads Arturo Merino Benitez is about 17 kilometres (11 mi) by car from Santiago\\'s city center. The airport is well served by the six-lane expressway Costanera Norte (Exit # 31), which crosses through the city from West to East bordering the Mapocho river, while it is also well connected to the West, North and North-East of Santiago by the Vespucio Norte Express Ring motorway (Exit # 18).\\n\\n## Taxi and shuttle services =There are two official airport taxi services: Taxi Oficial and Taxi Vip. TransVip shuttle services reach most of Santiago\\'s hotels, business and residential districts.\\n\\n## Bus Centropuerto buses connect the airport with the Los Héroes station of the Santiago Metro network, with an average arrival frequency of every 10 minutes on weekdays, and every 15 minutes on weekends. Turbus offers a similar service to its Alameda terminal. Both  services stop at the Pajaritos metro station/bus terminal on the way.\\nTwo public bus lines connect the airport to Santiago: Linea 555  connects to Pajaritos metro station (in the northern part of the city) and Linea 444  connects to the southern areas. Both lines connect with Metro Santiago via different stations.\\n\\n## Rental services =Car rental services are available from the airport.\\n\\n\\n## Accidents and incidents On 28 April 1969, LAN Chile Flight 160, a Boeing 727 arriving from Buenos Aires\\'s Ministro Pistarini International Airport, crash-landed 24 km (14 mi) north of Colina, Chile, roughly 50 km (31 mi) north of Arturo Merino Benítez Airport. None of the 60 passengers or crew were injured in the accident, though the aircraft was written-off.\\n', 'dOcutZ26h8RF', 'https://img.icons8.com/?size=150&id=dOcutZ26h8RF', '', '#f2e8ff', '#918b99']]\n"

As a Cathedral Church, it is the permanent seat of the Archbishop of Santiago and is dedicated to the Assumption of the Virgin Mary.\\nIt is located in the commune of Santiago, in front of the Plaza de Armas. The architectural ensemble of the cathedral is made up of the Archbishop&#x27;s Palace, the Parish del Sagrario and the cathedral itself. All these buildings are considered national monuments.\\nit was built between 1748 and 1906, designed by Joaqu\\u00edn Toesca and Ignacio Cremonesi. Many temples preceded the one that exists today, the current one being the fifth built on the site.\\n\\n\\n## History \\n## The earlier cathedrals =When refounding the city of Santiago de Chile on an Inca tambo, Pedro de Valdivia assigned the Inca temple to the northeast side of the Plaza Mayor or Plaza de Armas for the construction of a church, and while it was being built, religious services such as the Eucharist, they were celebrated at the door of the governor&#x27;s house, located where the Central Post Office is currently located. Probably, originally it must have consisted only of a chapel made of light materials, such as straw and mud; and at least since 1544, there is news that masses were no longer celebrated outdoors, so a suitable building had to be created to carry out Catholic practices.\\nBetween 1566 and 1600 the first cathedral temple was built. With much smaller dimensions than the current ones, it was richly decorated and was arranged in a north-south direction, with its fa\\u00e7ade on Calle Catedral. However, later, its main access would be facing the square, in the so-called \\&quot;Puerta del Perd\\u00f3n\\&quot;; especially after a controversy that occurred around the year 1600, where it was argued that the north door should be closed due to the indecency of the houses that were in front of it (because they were neighbors and not part of the cult). That door was partially or totally blinded until its destruction in 1769.\\nOn May 13, 1647, an earthquake affected the central area of the Captaincy General of Chile, destroying almost the entire city of Santiago along with the cathedral. However, the central nave of the cathedral withstood the attack, although its sagrario collapsed and its belongings could only be rescued days later. Thanks to the initiative of Bishop Gaspar de Villarroel, it was quickly retouched, although not for long. By 1657, a new telluric movement almost completely ruined its structure, and a second reconstruction had to be carried out between 1662 and 1687.\\n\\n## Bishop Gonz\\u00e1lez&#x27;s project =The 1730 Valpara\\u00edso earthquake once again cracked the cathedral structure, thus determining that the repairs carried out four decades earlier had been useless. To this was added the numerous accidents that had affected the structure. That is why, in 1746, Bishop Juan Gonz\\u00e1lez Melgarejo considered that the temple should be renovated in its entirety.\\nThe plans for this new cathedral were the work of Pedro Vogl and Juan Hagen, two members of the Society of Jesus, of Bavarian origin, who sent their project to Spain for royal approval in 1753. However, the work had already begun in 1748. After Vogl and Hagen, Mat\\u00edas V\\u00e1squez de Acu\\u00f1a and Francisco Antonio de Barros continued as directors of the works. The latter had a short time in the works, since in 1779 the Italian architect Joaqu\\u00edn Toesca made his appearance, to direct the construction.\\nBishop Gonz\\u00e1lez acquired the properties next to the cathedral, at the corner of the current Catedral and Bandera streets, which belonged to the Pineda Bascu\\u00f1\\u00e1n family; and decided to place the feet (the Altar) of the new building in Bandera and the front in the square, with a length of 100 meters, changing the direction that had originally been arranged by Valdivia in the 16th century. In order not to be forced to destroy the old temple, and to be able to continue celebrating religious services, Gonz\\u00e1lez ordered work to begin in the new section. On July 1, 1748, the first stone of the new building was laid.\\nGonz\\u00e1lez contributed 55,512 pesos with 4 1/2 reales for the work, and his successor Manuel de Alday with more than 160,000 pesos. The Crown, by 1788, had donated 97,994 pesos with 3 1/2 reales. For that year, 390,235 pesos with 5 and 1/8 reales had been spent on the cathedral, which had already been nearly two-thirds completed. After that they spent 48,964 pesos with 2 1/3 reales for the work, totaling 456,772 pesos with 8 and 3 reales in the cathedral.\\n\\n## The fire of 1769 =On the night of December 22, 1769, a fire broke out that destroyed the entire old cathedral, probably because the oil from the lamp that illuminated the Blessed Sacrament had spilled on some combustible object. To the clamor of the bells of the other churches, the people flocked to the scene of the incident, but it was already too late: only an image of the Virgin of Sorrows had been saved from the incident, which was located at the Puerta del Perd\\u00f3n. Apart from For this, according to V\\u00e1squez de Acu\\u00f1a, some molten silver and gold was saved thanks to the fire.\\nThe religious service was provisionally transferred to the Church of la Compa\\u00f1\\u00eda, which was in charge of Mercedarian religious as a result of the recent expulsion of the Jesuits from America.\\nHowever, this very circumstance was the event that accelerated the work on the cathedral. In December 1775, a part of the new temple was enabled, and the religious service was transferred there.\\n\\n## The Neoclassical cathedral of Toesca and Cremonesi In 1775, Bishop Manuel de Alday presided over its consecration. Only five years later, the prelate entrusted the Italian architect Joaqu\\u00edn Toesca with the execution of the facades of the cathedral and the Church del Sagrario. Toesca redid the plans, beginning by directing the works in the damaged sector, next to the square, and modifying part of the area already built, with which the temple was architecturally enriched. Imposing the Neoclassical style, and remaining in the works for nearly 20 years, Toesca became the most important architect of the cathedral works.\\nAround 1830 the building was almost finished, and in 1840, Pope Gregory XVI turned it into a Metropolitan Cathedral, elevating the seat of Santiago to Archiepiscopal rank. The order or decree of erection was later lost, so Pope Pius IX allowed a new one to be made, leaving September 29, 1873 as the definitive date. In total, the work had taken nearly 80 years to be completed. and its cost amounted to 600,000 pesos.\\nIn 1846 the construction of the Sagrario Chapel began, which was finished by Eusebio Chelli. A year later, Archbishop Rafael Valent\\u00edn Valdivieso commissioned Alexander Caldcleugh, a friend of the former treasurer of the Cathedral to buy an organ worthy of the cathedral building, while the National Congress approved the budget for it. In November 1849, the organ It arrived in Valpara\\u00edso by boat, and for its placement a choir had to be built over the main door of the cathedral, which in its first period was reinforced by fourteen English iron pillars arranged under it.\\nAt the end of the 19th century, Archbishop Mariano Casanova ordered a series of modifications that transformed the Cathedral into the building it currently exists. Casanova had decided to completely finish the construction of the cathedral, so he hired Ignacio Cremonesi and work began in 1898. Cremonesi&#x27;s design is inspired by a Tuscan or Roman style. In the transformations, the stone was covered with stucco and the wooden coffered ceiling was replaced by a sky painted with scenes in squares. The choir was first planned to be on the second level of pillars and beyond the arch. However, this meant that it was on the last ten rows of seats, so the idea was scrapped. The second option, and it was definitely left, was to leave it under the arch, which enormously increased the size of the choir but significantly restricted the sound capacity of the organ.\\nOn May 5, 1906, Casanova was finally able to consecrate the modified temple. Inside, the church was made up of three naves: two laterals and a taller central one. Cremonesi also added two towers to the fa\\u00e7ade.\\n\\n\\n## Description The main temple is made up of a plant with three naves. Its width is 45 meters and its length, from the fa\\u00e7ade to the doors facing Bandera street, is about 100 meters. This gives an area of about 4500 square meters.\\n\\n## Central nave In the central nave, the old main altar stands out at its bottom, crowned by a marble ciborium that preserves the crucifix inside, crowned by an eagle and guarded by angels, which was built in Munich in 1912, where masses were celebrated until that, between the 1960s and 1970s, in the archbishopric of Cardinal Ra\\u00fal Silva Henr\\u00edquez, a mobile wooden altar was made to celebrate Mass facing the town, but since it was not very decent for the surroundings, a front was placed in front of it silver 3 meters long. This altar was remodeled and modified between 2005 and 2006, in a work that involved the complete renovation of the presbytery and the total renovation of the archiepiscopal crypt. The mobile altar was replaced by a fixed one, the front of the mobile altar was destined for the Chapel of the Blessed Sacrament, and structural improvements were made to the presbytery.\\nAn ambon or wooden lectern in the shape of an eagle precedes the altar, going up the stairs of the presbytery. To its left, on the pilaster, there is a large crucifix, a donation from Pope Pius XI. Next, are the carved wooden seats, where the priests that make up the Metropolitan Council are located. In the middle of the left arm of the presbytery, under a wooden canopy, is the chair (wooden throne where the Archbishop sits during religious services). Right on the pilaster located in front of the canopy of the chair, there is a large painting that exhibits the coat of arms of the Archbishop in office.\\nIn the center of the presbytery is the new fixed altar, made up of a smooth block of granite, guarded by a set made up of a crucifix and six silver candlesticks, as required for the Pontifical Mass. Behind the new altar is the old high altar, already mentioned. At the end of the complex, next to the old altar on the right side, is the choir organ, a pipe organ built by the German Jesuits of Calera de Tango in 1754, and is still in use. In the central nave, the carved wooden pulpits from the 19th century also stand out.\\nOn the wall of the apse itself, there is in the upper part what we could call the main altarpiece, headed by a wooden image of the Assumption of Our Lady, patron saint of the cathedral, surrounded by angels and bronze rays, guarded by images of the Apostle Saint James the Great (patron of the city and of the archdiocese) and of Saint Rose of Lima, also in wood. Under this altarpiece, there is a window that illuminates the ciborium or manifestor where the crucifix is, and fills the central nave with light. At the feet, there is an image of Saint Francis Xavier recumbent. On its sides there are two doors that go out towards Bandera street, forming a simple rear fa\\u00e7ade.\\nOn the other hand, in the choir that is located above the main door, there is the great pipe organ made in the Flight &amp; Son house in London. Since the 1980s, its sound capacity is totally null.\\n\\n## Archiepiscopal crypt Under the slab of the presbytery is the archiepiscopal crypt, where the archbishops of Santiago are commonly buried. Formerly the crypt was a dark and battered place but, at the initiative of Cardinal Carlos Oviedo Cavada, a project was drawn up to build a new one under the main altar, more worthy of preserving the remains of the prelates. Remodeled in 2005, it currently has a modern and sober appearance, headed by a colonial Christ in a crucifixion attitude and a small granite altar. To its sides are, in the walls, the niches where some of the bishops and archbishops of Santiago rest. In addition to the diocesan bishops and archbishops, other prelates rest, such as the apostolic nuncio, Monsignor Aldo Laghi, whose only nunciature was that of Chile, being ordained a bishop on September 18 (chosen by him in homage to Chile), and dying in this country according to his wish.\\nBehind the old main altar, the civil crypts of Diego Portales and Jos\\u00e9 Tom\\u00e1s Ovalle are located.\\n\\n## Right nave =In the right nave, the tombs of great personalities of the country&#x27;s history stand out, of the first bishops and characters of the Criollo aristocracy.\\nNext to the right door of the Plaza de Armas is the monument and marble amphora where the hearts of the Chilean officers killed in the Battle of La Concepci\\u00f3n in 1882 are preserved. It is neo-Gothic in style and white marble, and was inaugurated in 1912. Adjacent to the door of Calle Catedral is the carved wooden tombstone in memory of the Carrera brothers (Javiera, Juan Jos\\u00e9, Jos\\u00e9 Miguel and Luis Carrera), whose tomb still remains unlocated inside the cathedral building. Also noteworthy for this nave are the tombs of Monsignor Jos\\u00e9 Antonio Mart\\u00ednez de Aldunate, Bishop-elect of Santiago and Vice President of the First National Government Board; and that of Monsignor Joaqu\\u00edn Larra\\u00edn Gandarillas, founder and first rector of the Pontifical Catholic University of Chile, inside a bronze sarcophagus.\\nIn this section there are eight side altars, dedicated to:\\n\\nSaint Francis of Paola.\\nSaint Francis de Sales, made of white, black and green marble.\\nSaint Alberto Hurtado\\nSaint Teresa of Jesus of the Andes, with relics of the saint.\\nTransfiguration of Jesus, with a copy of the homonymous painting by Raphael.\\nOur Lady of Mount Carmel, with a painting of the Virgin giving the scapular to the Carmelite Simon Stock (work by Jacques Pillard, made in Rome in 1864).\\nOur Lord Jesus Christ, where a relics of Saint Macrinus (or Macrobio), a martyr of the primitive Church, are kept.\\nSaint Peter\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n&quot;, &quot;images&quot;: [&quot;https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/1/1a/2017_Santiago_de_Chile_-_Catedral_de_Santiago.jpg&quot;, &quot;https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/0/0b/Altar_San_Francisco_de_Sales.jpg&quot;, &quot;https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/9/9c/CarrerasenCatedral.jpg&quot;, &quot;https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/c/c0/Catedral_Metropolitana_de_Santiago._Imagen_del_Padre_Alberto_Hurtado.JPG&quot;], &quot;near&quot;: [], &quot;lat&quot;: -70.6513936, &quot;lon&quot;: -33.4375808, &quot;maps&quot;: &quot;https://www.google.com/maps/search/?api=1&amp;query=Metropolitan%20Cathedral%20of%20Santiago%20Pl.%20de%20Armas%20498%2C%208320341%20Santiago%2C%20Regi%C3%B3n%20Metropolitana%2C%20Chile&quot;, &quot;citymapper&quot;: &quot;https://citymapper.com/directions?endcoord=-33.4375808,-70.6513936&amp;endname=Metropolitan%20Cathedral%20of%20Santiago&quot;, &quot;icon&quot;: &quot;https://img.icons8.com/?size=150&amp;id=EqXyHHDwjo4U&quot;}\n",

Plaza de Armas metro station is located under the square. Surrounding the square are some historic buildings, including the Metropolitan Cathedral of Santiago, Central Post Office Building, Palacio de la Real Audiencia de Santiago, and the building that serves as the seat of local government for Santiago, which was formerly occupied by the Cabildo of the city before being remodeled. There are also other architecturally significant buildings that face the square, including the Capilla del Sagrario, the Palacio arzobispal, the Edificio Comercial Edwards, and the Portal Fern\\u00e1ndez Concha. The Casa Colorada, the Cuartel General del Cuerpo de Bomberos de Santiago and the Museo Chileno de Arte Precolombino are located a short walk from the square.\\nThe square, the nearby former National Congress building and surrounding buildings were registered on 3 December 1986 as a national monument as a zona t\\u00edpica.\\n\\n\\n## History The church is the centerpiece of the initial layout of Santiago, which has a square grid pattern. This urban design was accomplished by Pedro de Gamboa, who was appointed by Pedro de Valdivia in 1541.\\n\\n## Pre Hispanic Period (Pre Colonisation) =The Investigator Rub\\u00e9n Stehberg from the Museo Nacional de Historia Natural de Chile and Gonzalo Sotomayor of the Universidad Andr\\u00e9s Bello provided evidence in 1976, arguing that under the old city of Santiago where the Plaza de Armas is situated there is an old Inca settlement.There would have been a Tawantinsuyu (Inca Empire) urban centre, under the old city of Santiago, from which Inca roads went out in different directions and whose base of sustenance was hydro-agriculture and gold and silver mining, [...] the infrastructure of this installation would have been used by (the Spanish conqueror) Pedro de Valdivia to found the city of Santiago.\\n\\n## Spanish Colonial Period =The Chilean Capital was founded by Pedro de Valdivia. With a chequerboard format, similar to a Chess board, it was designed by the architect Pedro de Gamboa. It was thus planned to build a central square around which the main administrative buildings were to be erected. This square or plaza was erected above the old city or Cancha inca.\\nAround the plaza formed recovas or markets, as goods arrived in this area during the Colonial period. In the middle there was , galley para hang the sentenced and show royal power.\\n\\n\\n## Freedom of Latin America monument The monument is located at the center of the square and depicts an allegory of Freedom, with a woman breaking the chains of a native woman. It is made of Carrara marble and sculpted by Francesco Orselino. The monument replaced a bronze fountain made in 1671, which is presently located in La Moneda Palace.\\nOther commemorative structures include an equestrian statue of Pedro de Valdivia, a statue of James the Great, the indigenous peoples monument, a time capsule, and ground plaques, including that marking the kilometre zero of Santiago.\\n\\n\\n## Entorno \\nOn the west side of the square, on the northwest corner, is the Catedral Metropolitana de Santiago. Although the first construction of a church was carried out in conjunction with the founding of the city, the present building is the fifth to be built on the site. Construction began in 1748 and was completed in 1775. However, in 1780, the architect Joaqu\\u00edn Toesca designed a new fa\\u00e7ade for the Cathedral and the adjoining Iglesia del Sagrario. At the end of the century Ignacio Cremonesi was commissioned by Bishop Casanova to carry out an integral remodelling of the cathedral, which included new fa\\u00e7ades, a modification of the interior nave and the construction of two towers facing the square and a dome over the main altar.\\nFacing the north side of the Plaza are the old colonial government buildings. From west to east, the actual Correo Central, the Museo Hist\\u00f3rico Nacional and the Ilustre Municipalidad de Santiago are located.\\nThe building of the Central Post Office of Santiago occupies the site assigned in the foundation to the conqueror Pedro de Valdivia, where later the residence of the Governors of Chile and, after independence, of the Presidents was built until 1846, when the presidential residence was moved to the Palace of La Moneda. However, a fire almost completely destroyed the building, and it was restored in 1881, giving it the neoclassical style it has today. In 1903 a third floor and an upper dome were built.\\nThe Museo Hist\\u00f3rico Nacional is located in the former building of the Palacio de la Real Audiencia, the main colonial court in the country. Built between 1804 and 1807 by a disciple of Toesca, after the Independence of Chile it was the seat of various ministries until they were moved to La Moneda, as was the presidential residence. In 1982 the current museum was opened, bringing together various historical collections.\\nThe building of the Municipality occupies the site where the colonial cabildo of the city and the old colonial jail, built between 1578 and 1647, were originally built. In 1679, the second construction of the building was demolished and rebuilt by Toesca, now in neoclassical styles in 1790. A fire in 1891 forced a reconstruction by the architect Eugenio Joannon, and the new building was inaugurated in 1895 and officially declared the seat of the communal administration.\\nAround the Plaza there are also various commercial premises, such as the Portal Fern\\u00e1ndez Concha, located in front of the southern side of the Plaza. This shopping centre was built in 1869 and gathers both typical Chilean and international food shops and shops with different articles. In the area around the Cathedral, in the streets Puente and Catedral, there is an area that has been informally called \\&quot;Little Lima\\&quot; due to the large number of immigrants of Peruvian origin and commerce destined to serve them that has settled nearby.\\n&quot;, &quot;images&quot;: [&quot;https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/8/8e/A_history_of_Chile_-_Plaza_del_Armas%2C_Santiago.png&quot;, &quot;https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/9/95/Plaza_de_Armas%2C_Congreso_Nacional_y_su_entorno.JPG&quot;, &quot;https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/3/3e/Plaza_de_Armas.JPG&quot;, &quot;https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/e/ed/Plaza_de_Armas_de_Santiago_de_Chile_en_1850-3.jpg&quot;], &quot;near&quot;: [], &quot;lat&quot;: -70.6510923, &quot;lon&quot;: -33.4378941, &quot;maps&quot;: &quot;https://www.google.com/maps/search/?api=1&amp;query=Plaza%20de%20Armas%20de%20Santiago%20Pl.%20de%20Armas%2C%20Santiago%2C%20Regi%C3%B3n%20Metropolitana%2C%20Chile&quot;, &quot;citymapper&quot;: &quot;https://citymapper.com/directions?endcoord=-33.4378941,-70.6510923&amp;endname=Plaza%20de%20Armas%20de%20Santiago&quot;, &quot;icon&quot;: &quot;https://img.icons8.com/?size=150&amp;id=nxVWmOWM0rag&quot;}\n",

It also houses the offices of three cabinet ministers: Interior, General Secretariat of the Presidency, and General Secretariat of the Government. Located in downtown Santiago, it occupies an entire block in the Civic District, bordered by Moneda street to the north, Morand\\u00e9 street to the east, Alameda del Libertador Bernardo O&#x27;Higgins to the south, and Teatinos street to the west.\\n\\n\\n## History La Moneda, was the colonial mint house of the city during colonial times, was designed by the Italian architect Joaqu\\u00edn Toesca. Construction began in 1784 and was opened in 1805. The production of coins in Chile took place at La Moneda from 1814 to 1929.\\n\\nIn June 1845 during president Manuel Bulnes&#x27;s administration, the palace became the seat of government and presidential residence. In 1930, a public square\\u2014named Plaza de la Constituci\\u00f3n (\\&quot;Constitution Square\\&quot;)\\u2014was built in front of the palace. After the presidency of Gabriel Gonz\\u00e1lez Videla it ceased to serve as a presidential residence.\\nDuring the military coup d&#x27;\\u00e9tat on September 11, 1973, the Chilean Air Force strafed the palace with unguided rockets and automatic cannon fire. The president Salvador Allende died in the palace at this time. Restoration projects of the damage caused were completed in March 1981, although some bullet marks have been preserved and can still be seen today. During the 1973\\u20131980 restorations, an underground office complex (the so-called \\&quot;bunker\\&quot;) was built under the front square to provide a safe escape for the dictator Augusto Pinochet in case of an attack.\\nUnder the presidency of Eduardo Frei Ruiz-Tagle, the palace was painted white. During President Ricardo Lagos&#x27;s administration, the palace&#x27;s inner courtyards were opened to the public during certain hours of the day. Lagos also re-opened Morand\\u00e9 80\\u2014a gate used by Chilean presidents to enter the palace since the early 20th century. It was eliminated during the restoration of the palace as not being in the original plans, but was restored because of the heavy symbolism attached to it as being the gate through which Chilean Presidents entered La Moneda skipping the main&#x27;s gate guard protocol or, in other words, as ordinary citizens of the country. It was also the gate through which the body of President Allende was taken out after the 1973 coup.\\n\\nA traditional changing of the guard ceremony takes place every two days   on odd-numbered days in odd-numbered months, even-numbered days in even-numbered months, including Sundays, at 10 a.m. weekdays and 11 a.m. on weekends (as of June 2015).  A formal ceremony dating back to the 1850s, it lasts about 30 minutes and includes a band playing, troops with horses parading into the square, and much pomp and circumstance. The Carabineros de Chile provides the guard unit and band for the ceremony, the guard unit being composed of a Foot Guards battalion and a Horse Guards squadron.\\n\\n\\n## Architecture \\n## Construction =Joaqu\\u00edn Toesca had worked on many public buildings in colonial Chile, including the Santiago Metropolitan Cathedral, before he was engaged to design the new royal mint that would become the Palacio de la Moneda.\\nWorks on the building started in 1784, with building materials arriving the following year from around Chile and the world: limestone from the Polpaico country estate; sand from the Maipo River; red stones from a quarry at the Cerro San Crist\\u00f3bal in Santiago; white stone from the neighbouring Cerro Blanco; oak and cypress wood from Valdivia; Spanish metal works from Vizcaya. Twenty varieties of brick were baked in Santiago for the construction of lintels, comers, floors, moldings, and of the solid walls more than a meter thick.\\nToesca died in 1799, before seeing his work finished, and military engineer Agustin Cavallero took over the project. The \\u201cMint House of Santiago de Chile\\u201d finally opened in 1805.\\nIn 1929, an annex was commissioned the then President Carlos Ib\\u00e1\\u00f1ez del Campo to give the palace a facade to face the Alameda Avenue, the main street of Santiago. The project was designed by Josu\\u00e9 Smith strictly following the design of the original construction. The three-floor annex was built using part of the original construction that was occupied until that date by the mint, which was relocated to a site adjacent to Quinta Normal Park.\\nIn 1940, a former mint pavilion, part of the original design of Toesca, was demolished to make way for the Patio de los Naranjos.\\n\\n## Architectural style =The Palacio de la Moneda is built in a pure neoclassical style with Roman Doric influences. The building&#x27;s wide, horizontal shape and rectangular composition conveys strength and stability, according to the palace&#x27;s listing on the UNESCO website. Its main fa\\u00e7ade faces Moneda street, and its rooms are distributed along the transverse and longitudinal axes forming several patios.\\nBehind this fa\\u00e7ade lie three patios: the Patio de los Ca\\u00f1ones, which functions as an entrance hall; a covered patio; and finally the Patio de los Naranjos, where presidential ceremonies take place.\\nThe architecture website ARQHYS.com states that the Palacio de la Moneda is \\u201cthe only structure in the pure Italian neoclassical style that exists in Latin America.\\u201d \\nThe building has been subject to several modifications throughout the years, made by different presidents. The last great restoration of the building was carried out after the 1973 military coup, when large portions of the building were destroyed or damaged.\\n\\n## Plaza de la Ciudadan\\u00eda =To celebrate the bicentenary of Chile&#x27;s independence in 2010, a new public square called the Plaza de la Ciudadan\\u00eda (\\u2018\\u2019Citizenry Square\\u2019\\u2019 in Spanish) was constructed on the south side of the palace stretching down to the Avenida Libertador General Bernardo O&#x27;Higgins or \\u201cAlameda\\u201d. Construction began in May 2004 and the plaza was inaugurated in December 2005.\\nDesigned by Undurraga Dev\\u00e9s Arquitectos, the Plaza de la Ciudadan\\u00eda has been called \\u201cone of the most important public works in the last century\\u201d by Chile&#x27;s Plataforma Arquitectura website. Paths leading down from the plaza give access to the underground Palacio de La Moneda Cultural Center, which hosts a range of exhibitions on Chilean culture and history.\\n&quot;, &quot;images&quot;: [&quot;https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/f/f5/Chile-02559_-_La_Moneda_Presidential_Palace_%2849033259257%29.jpg&quot;], &quot;near&quot;: [], &quot;lat&quot;: -70.6539455, &quot;lon&quot;: -33.4424189, &quot;maps&quot;: &quot;https://www.google.com/maps/search/?api=1&amp;query=Pal%C3%A1cio%20La%20Moneda%20Moneda%2C%20Santiago%2C%20Regi%C3%B3n%20Metropolitana%2C%20Chile&quot;, &quot;citymapper&quot;: &quot;https://citymapper.com/directions?endcoord=-33.4424189,-70.6539455&amp;endname=Pal%C3%A1cio%20La%20Moneda&quot;, &quot;icon&quot;: &quot;https://img.icons8.com/?size=150&amp;id=nxVWmOWM0rag&quot;}\n",

The museum was founded by the Chilean architect and antiquities collector Sergio Larra\\u00edn Garc\\u00eda-Moreno, who had sought premises for the display and preservation of his private collection of pre-Columbian artefacts acquired over the course of nearly fifty years. \\nWith the support of Santiago&#x27;s municipal government at the time, Garc\\u00eda-Moreno secured the building and established the museum&#x27;s curatorial institution. The museum first opened in December 1981.\\n\\n\\n## Building The museum is housed in the Palacio de la Real Aduana, which was constructed between 1805 and 1807. It is located a block west of the Plaza de Armas and close to the Palacio de los Tribunales de Justicia de Santiago and the Former National Congress Building.\\nIn January 2014, as a result of a partnership with Minera Escondida and BHP Billiton, the museum inaugurated a new phase designed by Chilean architect Smiljan Radic which involved a 70% expansion of the area, increasing exhibition spaces, storage, and the conservation laboratory.\\n\\n\\n## Collection \\nItems in the museum&#x27;s collections are drawn from the major pre-Columbian culture areas of Mesoamerica, Intermediate / Isthmo-Colombian, Pan-Caribbean, Amazonia and the Andean. The museum has over 3,000 pieces representing almost 100 different groups of people. The collection ranges from about 10,000 years. The original collection was acquired based on the aesthetic quality of the objects, instead of their scientific or historical context. The collection is broken up into four areas:\\n\\nArea mesoamerica: Includes a statue of Xipe Totec, an incense burner from the Teotihuacan culture, and a Mayan bas-relief.\\nArea Intermedia: Showcase pieces include pottery from the Valdivia people, and Capuli figures chewing coca leaf. Gold objects from the Veraguas and Diquis cultures are also represented.\\nArea Andes Centrales: Features masks and copper figures, of which many were confiscated from graves. Examples include those from the Moche and textiles. The oldest textile in the museum is in this area, a painted cloth almost 3,000 years old from the Chav\\u00edn culture.\\nArea Andes del Sur: This collection features modern Chilean and Argentinian pieces. Ceramic urns from the Aguada culture, snuff trays from the San Pedro culture, and an Incan quipu.\\n&quot;, &quot;images&quot;: [], &quot;near&quot;: [], &quot;lat&quot;: -70.6523921, &quot;lon&quot;: -33.4386677, &quot;maps&quot;: &quot;https://www.google.com/maps/search/?api=1&amp;query=Museu%20Chileno%20de%20Arte%20Pr%C3%A9-Colombiana%20Bandera%20361%2C%208320298%20Santiago%2C%20Regi%C3%B3n%20Metropolitana%2C%20Chile&quot;, &quot;citymapper&quot;: &quot;https://citymapper.com/directions?endcoord=-33.4386677,-70.6523921&amp;endname=Museu%20Chileno%20de%20Arte%20Pr%C3%A9-Colombiana&quot;, &quot;icon&quot;: &quot;https://img.icons8.com/?size=150&amp;id=lAwJ42xa0VsG&quot;}\n",

Concha y Toro Winery is located in Santiago de Chile, but the company has vineyards in Chile, Argentina and the United States, with more than 10,000 hectares under cultivation in 2016. Their Casillero del Diablo and Don Melchor wines have international recognition. As of 2010 the company is one of the official sponsors of the English football club Manchester United F. C.\\n\\n\\n## History \\n## 19th century The Concha y Toro Vineyard was founded by Don Melchor de Santiago Concha y Toro, ex-Minister of Finance, and his wife, Emiliana Subercaseaux, in 1883. To start the winery, he brought grape varieties from the Bordeaux region in France: Cabernet Sauvignon, Sauvignon Blanc, Semillon, Merlot, and Carm\\u00e9n\\u00e8re.\\nConcha y Toro&#x27;s connections to Chilean nobility and aristocracy are not merely historical. Currently the Vina Concha y Toro continues in the sphere of the Marquesado de Casa Concha, and is additionally controlled by the Guilisasti and Larra\\u00edn families. The directors currently include the present Marquess of Casa Concha, Chilean diplomat and ambassador Mariano Fontecilla de Santiago-Concha, great-grandson of the founder. In 1999, the company&#x27;s president Alfonso Larra\\u00edn Santa Mar\\u00eda claimed the title of Marquess of Larra\\u00edn in Spain. His mother, the current Marchioness, gave Larra\\u00edn the power to claim the title.\\nVineyards and factories of Concha y Toro in Pirque, Santiago Metropolitan Region, are connected by roads with names such as Marqu\\u00e9s de Casa Concha or Conde de la Conquista, titles connected to the history of the company.\\n\\n## 20th century: expansion =The vineyard was incorporated as a stock company in 1923 and shares continue to be sold in the Santiago Stock Exchange. Concha y Toro began exporting wine in March 1933 to the port of Rotterdam, the Netherlands. In 1950, the winery began to acquire more vineyards and also began the process of adapting its business to new markets and meeting a higher demand.\\nIn 1966, the Casillero del Diablo brand, the company&#x27;s hallmark, was inaugurated, and in 1987 the company&#x27;s first ultra-premium wine, Don Melchor, was launched. In the late 1960s the company began to expand: Vi\\u00f1a Maipo was acquired in 1968; Vi\\u00f1a Cono Sur created in 1993; Trivento Bodegas in Argentina founded in 1996; a joint venture with Ch\\u00e2teau Mouton Rothschild for the production of Vi\\u00f1a Almaviva began in 1997, among others.\\nIn 1971, Eduardo Guilisasti Tagle became chairman of the board, who succeeded in expanding the company. In 1987, after partnering with U.S. importer Banfi Vintners, the company started to incorporate more advanced technology in all of its production stages. It also started using small French oak barriques.

In 2010 a sponsorship agreement was signed with the English club Manchester United F.C. In this respect, Manchester United 2020 sponsorship director, Sean Jefferson, said: \\&quot;Manchester United&#x27;s relationship with Casillero del Diablo has been one of the most extensive and successful partnerships we ever had. The synergy between the two brands have led to a natural alliance\\&quot;, especially due to equivalence of their symbols and distinctive seals.\\nIn 2011 Concha y Toro bought in United States Fetzer Vineyards, for a value of US$238 million.

Now a popular tourist hub, Barrio Lastarria is a center for cultural activity, with cinemas, theaters, museums, restaurants and bars.

As with many neighborhoods in Santiago\\u2019s center, Barrio Lastarria was built around a church: in this case, the Iglesia de la Veracruz. Houses were built between the winding streets, notably the house at Plaza Mulato Gil de Castro, built in the beginning of the 19th century. Despite the neighborhood\\u2019s early origins, the plaza was only built in 1981 due to interest in preserving a series of facades beginning at the historic house of Gil de Castro.\\nDuring the 1990s, the neighborhood began a process of restoration with care not to alter its bohemian and intellectual flavor, with a number of caf\\u00e9s, bars and cultural centers appearing towards the end of the decade and the restoration of facades of the Iglesia de la Veracruz in 2001 and 2002. Since then, as an historic area in Santiago, it has been able to maintain its traditional character despite new development. Barrio Lastarria was declared an official Zona T\\u00edpica by Chile in 1997.\\nDue to both the number of visitors and LGBT residents, on 5 November 2006, the Movement for Homosexual Integration and Liberation (Movilh) held an act in Parque Forestal to declare the sector as the first gay-friendly neighborhood in Santiago.\\n\\n\\n## Places of interest Caf\\u00e9s, cinemas and museums in J.V.

It is situated between Alameda del Libertador Bernardo O&#x27;Higgins in the south, Santa Luc\\u00eda Street in the west and Victoria Subercaseaux on the east. An adjacent metro station is named after it.  The hill has an altitude of 629 m and a height of 69 m over the surrounding area.  The hill is the remnant of a volcano 15 million years old.\\nThe hill comprises a 65,300 square metre park adorned with ornate facades, stairways and fountains. At the highest point there is a viewpoint popular with tourists visiting the city and meeting point.\\n\\n\\n## History It was originally called Huelito o heutrecan by the pre-colonization inhabitants. However, the current name comes from the day in which Pedro de Valdivia conquered the hill, on December 13, 1540. That day celebrates \\&quot;Santa Luc\\u00eda.\\&quot;\\nIts first use by its missionaries was as a point of worship, or prayer in the years of the chicken pox outbreak (1541).\\nIn 1816, Manuel Olaguer Feli\\u00fa, the Brigadier of the Royal Engineers, designed and built two forts or castles on Santa Luc\\u00eda Hill, one north and the other south of the hill. The forts were built out of stone and lime and could fit eight or twelve cannons each. Besides, Olaguer Feli\\u00fa drew and built an outbuilding for ammunition depot and to house the garrison.\\nOn one side of the hill, Fort Hidalgo was finished in 1820 as a defensive point. On the other side, the hillside terrain was used as a \\&quot;cemetery for the dissidents\\&quot;, people who did not follow the then-official Roman Catholic faith, or were considered otherwise unworthy of burial at hallowed grounds. However, the remains buried in the hillside under this fashion were eventually transferred to a secluded section of the General Cemetery, before said cemetery, in turn, was opened to all burials regardless of creed or social condition.\\nIn 1849 James Melville Gilliss led an American naval astronomical expedition to Chile in order to more precisely measure the solar parallax. An observatory was set up on Santa Luc\\u00eda Hill and operated by Gilliss. When the expedition ended in September 1852 the observatory and related equipment was sold to the Chilean government and formed the nucleus of the first National Astronomical Observatory.\\nIn 1872 Benjam\\u00edn Vicu\\u00f1a Mackenna decided to conduct a dramatic change to the urban atmosphere of the city of Santiago, among his many works aimed to improve the city, and thus initiated an extensive remodelation of the hill.\\nThe works of 1872 consisted of a road which crossed the hill, which at the top accessed a chapel which he also built there, illuminated by the then-novel means of gas. The rest of the hill contains a park with fountains and lookouts. The actual hill is watered by a sophisticated irrigation system. The now iconic yellow and white facade is also a product of Vicu\\u00f1a Mackenna&#x27;s remodelation.\\nVicu\\u00f1a Mackenna was assisted in realizing his designs by the architect Manuel Aldunate, the constructor Enrique Henes, and the stonecutter Andr\\u00e9s Staimbuck.\\nA few years ago, Santa Luc\\u00eda hill received an improvement in its illumination system and protections. Also, Fort Hidalgo was restored and reopened to the public. Traditionally, a cannon shot is fired exactly at noon.\\n\\n\\n## Curiosity \\nLocated in Santa Luc\\u00eda Hill there is a monument which consists of a 2 m high stone carved with a paragraph extracted from the text that Pedro de Valdivia sent to emperor Charles V describing the features of the new land conquered.\\n\\n\\n## In popular culture Santa Luc\\u00eda Hill is one of the entrances to the abyss in the videogame Abyss Odyssey, the entrance is located in the east part of the Terraza Neptuno.\\nSanta Luc\\u00eda Hill was featured on the second episode of The Amazing Race 7 with the competing teams finishing their leg in Santiago at Terraza Neptuno.

Within the pedestal there is a small chapel in which Pope John Paul II prayed and blessed the city of Santiago on April 1, 1987. The statue is lit up at night by lights placed on its sides, allowing it to be viewed from all over Santiago both day and night.\\nAt the foot of the statue there is an amphitheater for holding masses or other religious ceremonies. Near the statue, there is also a small chapel for praying.\\nAt the foothills of Cerro San Crist\\u00f3bal are the Chilean National Zoo and a Japanese-style garden, and up there are also two municipal pools, Tupahue and Antil\\u00e9n.\\nCerro San Crist\\u00f3bal houses Santiago&#x27;s largest public park: the Santiago Metropolitan Park (Parque Metropolitano).\\n\\n\\n## Access The summit of Cerro San Crist\\u00f3bal can be reached by foot (about a 45-minute walk, involving a 300m change in elevation), by car via the road joining the Santiago Metropolitan Park, by the Funicular de Santiago (the base of which sits next to the Zoo at the North end of Pio Nono in Barrio Bellavista), or by a Teleferico (cable car located northeast at the Oasis station).\\nA cable car provided service to the top of the hill from the Pedro de Valdivia entrance since 1980 until 2009, when the gearbox controlling the system&#x27;s speed exploded, leaving the system unusable. A project was presented in 2011 to open for tender on the system, giving it new cabins and restore infrastructure. The service was expected to be back in 2012, however the Ministry of Housing and Urban Planning received only one offer that was rejected, so the tender was ended and a new public contest was announced, that began in 2013.Then, in December 2014 it was announced that the cable car would re-open in the second semester of 2016 after a series of maintenance and remodeling works to be done from March 2015, costing US$9.5 million. These works complete the installation of the new 46 cabin network, of which 8 will be enabled for the transport of bicycles, strollers or wheelchairs. The transport cabins have a 6-person capacity and the system was reopened in November 2016.\\nFrom the top of the hill are two pools \\u2013 Tupahue and Antil\\u00e9n, and access the National Zoo of Chile at the Bellavista entrance to Cerro San Crist\\u00f3bal. The Children&#x27;s Park of Cerro San Crist\\u00f3bal also provides entrance to the hill via Avenida Per\\u00fa.\\n&quot;, &quot;images&quot;: [&quot;https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/5/5f/Relief_Map_of_Chile.jpg&quot;, &quot;https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/2/20/San_Crist%C3%B3bal_altura.jpg&quot;, &quot;https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/1/1c/Virgen_San_Crist%C3%B3bal.JPG&quot;], &quot;near&quot;: [], &quot;lat&quot;: -70.6313749, &quot;lon&quot;: -33.4202404, &quot;maps&quot;: &quot;https://www.google.com/maps/search/?api=1&amp;query=Cerro%20San%20Crist%C3%B3bal%20San%20Crist%C3%B3bal%20Hill%2C%20Recoleta%2C%20Santiago%20Metropolitan%20Region%2C%20Chile&quot;, &quot;citymapper&quot;: &quot;https://citymapper.com/directions?endcoord=-33.4202404,-70.6313749&amp;endname=Cerro%20San%20Crist%C3%B3bal&quot;, &quot;icon&quot;: &quot;https://img.icons8.com/?size=150&amp;id=M0ClAYLFXhjv&quot;}\n",

Owned by Cencosud, the complex consists of four skyscrapers, including the Gran Torre Santiago, two high-end hotels, an office building, and a six-floor shopping mall.\\nThe Gran Torre Santiago, which stands as the tallest of the four buildings, was designed by renowned architect C\\u00e9sar Pelli and measures 300 metres (980 ft) tall. It is the second tallest building in Latin America, following Torres Obispado, and the fifth tallest in the Southern Hemisphere, after Indonesia&#x27;s Autograph Tower and Luminary Tower in Jakarta and Australia&#x27;s Q1 on the Gold Coast and Australia 108 in Melbourne. One of the other buildings in the complex is 170 metres (560 ft) high, while the other is only four stories.\\nConstruction of the Costanera Center was temporarily halted in January 2009 due to the late 2000s recession. The developers were concerned that they would not be able to find tenants if completed by the originally proposed date. After the recession ended, Cencosud announced that construction would resume on December 16, 2009. The construction process restarted at the end of 2010.\\nOn February 14, 2012, the Gran Torre Santiago reached 300 meters and became the tallest building in South and Latin America. The mall in the complex, designed by Canadian retail agency Watt International, opened on June 12, 2012, and is the largest in South America. It comprises six floors and includes the Jumbo (hypermarket).\\n&quot;, &quot;images&quot;: [], &quot;near&quot;: [], &quot;lat&quot;: -70.6064265, &quot;lon&quot;: -33.4177363, &quot;maps&quot;: &quot;https://www.google.com/maps/search/?api=1&amp;query=Sky%20Costanera%20Av.%20Andr%C3%A9s%20Bello%202425%2C%207510689%20Providencia%2C%20Regi%C3%B3n%20Metropolitana%2C%20Chile&quot;, &quot;citymapper&quot;: &quot;https://citymapper.com/directions?endcoord=-33.4177363,-70.6064265&amp;endname=Sky%20Costanera&quot;, &quot;icon&quot;: &quot;https://img.icons8.com/?size=150&amp;id=SXWgcDx9GIKM&quot;}\n",

Consisting of the San Crist\\u00f3bal, Chacarillas and Los Gemelos hills, and the areas of Tupahue, Lo Sald\\u00e9s, Pir\\u00e1mide and Bosque Santiago, the park is located between four communes of Santiago \\u2013 Huechuraba, Providencia, Recoleta and Vitacura \\u2013 and covers around 722 hectares, making it the largest urban park of the Americas and one of the largest in the world.\\nThe Santiago Metropolitan Park also maintains 16 Urban Parks distributed throughout 13 communes in Santiago, a total area of almost 150.1 hectares. The maintenance work is carried out through \\u201cUrban Parks\\u2019 Conservation, Maintenance and Safety\\u201d projects which involve cleaning, irrigation, replantation and management of vegetal species, maintenance of urban equipment, sanitation control, weed control, fertilization and safety among other activities.\\nThe park was created in April 1966, when incorporating the Chilean National Zoo and the services of San Crist\\u00f3bal Hill, and is managed by the Ministry of Housing and Urban Development. In September, 2012, the Chilean government launched a plan to significantly refurbish and expand the park between 2012 and 2016, a plan which includes building new footpaths, planting 100,000 more trees and expanding the National Zoo.\\n\\n\\n## Origins and history \\nSan Crist\\u00f3bal Hill began to be used in 1903 with the installation of the Mills Observatory, currently known as the Manuel Foster Observatory, twin of the Lick Observatory of the University of California.\\nThe main icon on the hill, the Statue of the Virgin Mary on San Crist\\u00f3bal Hill, was inaugurated on April 26, 1908.\\nIn 1916, a project led by Alberto Mackenna Subercaseaux and Pedro Bannen sought to transform the hill into a park and public recreational area. On September 28, 1917, Law No. 3295 was published in the Official Gazette which authorized president Juan Luis Sanfuentes to accept donations, purchase or expropriate land located between Bosque Santiago and San Crist\\u00f3bal Hill, inclusive. Said land was declared for public use and the creation of the future park.\\nThe then Intendant of Santiago, Pablo Urz\\u00faa, took official possession of the park&#x27;s land on June 17, 1918. It was however during the period of intendant Alberto Mackenna, between 1921 and 1927, that the Hill was landscaped and prepared for public use.\\n\\n\\n## Attractions \\n## Pools The park has two open-air pools: the Tupahue pool (meaning \\u201cplace of God\\u201d in Quechua) and Antil\\u00e9n pool (\\u201cthere is sun\\u201d in Mapundungun). Both operate in the summer from November through March.\\nThe Tupahue pool was opened in 1966 on Tupahue hill, in what was originally a quarry. Surrounded by vegetation, there is a stone wall by Chilean muralist Mar\\u00eda Martner and Mexican Juan O\\u2019Gorman. The pool is 82 meters long and 25 meters wide.\\nThe Antil\\u00e9n pool was opened in 1976. It is located on the summit of Chacarillas hill with a 360-degree panoramic view of the city. The pool is 92 meters long and 25 meters wide.\\n\\n## Cable car =The Santiago Cable Car was opened in 1980 and takes visitors from the base of the hill, in Pedro de Valdivia Norte neighborhood (Estaci\\u00f3n Oasis) to the summit (Estaci\\u00f3n Cumbre) in 20 minutes, passing through Tupahue station. The Tupahue pool is located at Estaci\\u00f3n Tupahue, as is the Mapulemu Botanic Garden (\\u201cforest of the earth\\u201d in Mapundungun) and the Camino Real restaurant.\\nAt the summit, tourists can visit the Sanctuary on San Crist\\u00f3bal Hill and take the Funicular, which runs between Barrio Bellavista and the summit of San Crist\\u00f3bal Hill.\\nAs of 2012, the Cable Car remains closed due to mechanical failures. Its restoration has been marked as part of the government&#x27;s Bicentenary Plan.\\nIn December 2014, it was announced that the cable car would be reopening in 2016 with work on the project starting in March 2015. The project will cost 9.5 million dollars. The cable car was reopened in November 2016.\\n\\n## Funicular =The Funicular de Santiago, which dates from 1925, has been declared a National Monument. It has two stations:  the National Zoo and  the summit. The funicular runs for almost 500 meters on a 45 degree incline, departing from Barrio Bellavista.\\nThe funicular has two carriages, with one displaying a memorial plaque commemorating Pope John Paul II, who rode in the carriage in 1987 en route to saying mass at the feet of the Virgin Mary statue located at the hill&#x27;s summit.\\nIn September 2012, the funicular was marked for refurbishment as part of the Chilean government&#x27;s Bicentenary Plan.\\n\\n## National Zoo =The Chilean National Zoo has thousands of animals representing 158 species.\\n\\n## Botanical Garden Located within the park, the Botanical Garden contains various plants native to Chile and its mission includes conservation and research.\\n\\n## Sanctuary A religious sanctuary atop San Crist\\u00f3bal Hill commemorating the Immaculate Conception, is notable for its large statue of the Virgin Mary.\\n\\n## Bicentenary Children&#x27;s Park =This park was opened in  2012 and has an amphitheater, treehouses, water features, interactive fence and a cable car.\\n\\n\\n## Torre Antena \\nAs it stands today, there are numerous Radio Antennas on the top of the hill that have become an eyesore. The Government of Santiago has come up with a solution to tear down all the existing antennas and instead combine them in one giant antenna that would also serve as a new landmark for Santiago. In late 2013 the city held a design contest for the new tower with the winning bid being announced in February of the following year.\\n&quot;, &quot;images&quot;: [], &quot;near&quot;: [], &quot;lat&quot;: -70.6201676, &quot;lon&quot;: -33.4000006, &quot;maps&quot;: &quot;https://www.google.com/maps/search/?api=1&amp;query=Parque%20Metropolitano%20de%20Santiago%20Acceso%20Zapadores%20Parquemet%20-%20Los%20Zapadores%2C%20esq.%20Los%20Turistas%20y%2C%20H%C3%A9roes%20de%20La%20Concepci%C3%B3n%2C%20Recoleta%2C%20Regi%C3%B3n%20Metropolitana%2C%20Chile&quot;, &quot;citymapper&quot;: &quot;https://citymapper.com/directions?endcoord=-33.4000006,-70.6201676&amp;endname=Parque%20Metropolitano%20de%20Santiago&quot;, &quot;icon&quot;: &quot;https://img.icons8.com/?size=150&amp;id=Ah17OpXv85zO&quot;}\n",

Subsequently, on June 7, 2009, another mechanical failure occurred in the system: the gearbox that regulated the speed of the system exploded, which caused the indefinite suspension of the service.\\n\\n## Second era (2016-present) =In 2011 a project was presented to tender the cable car, provide it with new cabins and restore the infrastructure. It was expected that in 2012 the service reopened the public, nevertheless the Ministry of Housing and Urban Development received only one offer which it rejected, reason why it declared deserted the licitation and announced a new public contest, that began in November 2013.\\nIn December 2014, it was announced that the cable car would be reopened in the second half of 2016, following a series of maintenance and remodeling works that began in March 2015 and will cost 9.5 million dollars. These works included the installation of the new network of 47 cabins with capacity for six people each.\\n\\nIn January 2016, the Chilean Ministry of Housing and Urban Development launched a public competition for social and non-governmental organizations, neighborhood or municipal councils to submit projects to recover assets of the 56 cabins that were discontinued and which were part of the original system in 1980. On July 29 of the same year the winning projects, which included libraries, recreational spaces, and a motorized train in Pueblito Las Vizcachas were presented at the Espacio Matta Cultural Center.\\nThe cable car was reopened on November 24, 2016, by President Michelle Bachelet. Between December 14 and 16, the cable car closed temporarily due to its first maintenance operation after reaching 500 operating hours and receiving more than 68 thousand visits in 16 days.\\n\\n\\n## Characteristics \\nThe new cable car has 47 cabins (16 red, 16 blue and 15 green) that can carry up to 6 people each, plus 8 cars designed exclusively to carry bicycles (four in each cart) and a maintenance trolley. Its speed varies between 1 and 5 meters per second (18 km/h).\\nThe system has three stations: Oasis, Tupahue and Cumbre. In the latter it connects with the Funicular de Santiago. The Tupahue is located near the Tupahue Pool, the Mapulemu Botanical Garden (\\&quot;Forest of the Earth\\&quot;) and the Camino Real Restaurant.\\n&quot;, &quot;images&quot;: [&quot;https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/0/0a/Antiguo_huevito_Teleferico_de_Santiago.jpg&quot;, &quot;https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/c/cc/Estaci%C3%B3n_Tupahue_del_telef%C3%A9rico_del_Cerro_San_Crist%C3%B3bal.jpg&quot;, &quot;https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/0/0e/Mandataria_reinaugura_el_Telef%C3%A9rico_del_Parque_Metropolitano_de_Santiago_%2831182512236%29.jpg&quot;, &quot;https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/5/58/Telef%C3%A9rico_Parque_Metropolitano.jpg&quot;], &quot;near&quot;: [], &quot;lat&quot;: -70.6155955, &quot;lon&quot;: -33.4146797, &quot;maps&quot;: &quot;https://www.google.com/maps/search/?api=1&amp;query=Telef%C3%A9rico%20Cerro%20San%20Crist%C3%B3bal%20Av.%20El%20Cerro%20750%2C%207500000%20Providencia%2C%20Regi%C3%B3n%20Metropolitana%2C%20Chile&quot;, &quot;citymapper&quot;: &quot;https://citymapper.com/directions?endcoord=-33.4146797,-70.6155955&amp;endname=Telef%C3%A9rico%20Cerro%20San%20Crist%C3%B3bal&quot;, &quot;icon&quot;: &quot;https://img.icons8.com/?size=150&amp;id=dSop1JRmi76I&quot;}\n",

It was inaugurated by then-president Michelle Bachelet on January 11, 2010, as part of government&#x27;s commemoration of the bicentennial of Chile.\\n\\n\\n## History \\nIn her speech on May 21, 2007, before the full Congress, President Michelle Bachelet announced the construction of a memorial museum, and a month later she announced a public competition to select an architectural design for it. On August 28 of that year, it was announced that the winning project belonged to a group of Brazilian architects from the office \\&quot;Estudio America\\&quot;, located in S\\u00e3o Paulo. In 2008, a contest to determine who would be in charge of the operation of the museum; \\&quot;\\u00c1rbol de Color S. A.\\&quot; was chosen.\\nThe first stone of the museum was laid on December 10, 2008, by Bachelet, who was herself a victim of torture during the dictatorship of Pinochet. The materials and documentation for the museum&#x27;s collection were mostly provided by the organization Casa de la Memoria, whose donations arrived on June 16, 2009, at the La Moneda Palace. Parallel to the construction of the museum, on December 3, 2009, the museum&#x27;s board was formed, and on January 6, 2010, Romy Schmidt was appointed as its executive director. Bachelet inaugurated the museum on January 11, 2010, two months before the end of her term.\\nThe museum houses torture devices used during the Pinochet dictatorship, letters to family members by prisoners in detention centers, newspaper clippings, and testimony from survivors.  The museum also includes a philosophical examination of human rights. Chilean popular icon and folksinger V\\u00edctor Jara&#x27;s last poem, Estadio Chile, written shortly before his death in the stadium during the 1973 coup, sprawls across the entrance to the museum.\\nIn 2013, the Foundation Museo de la Memoria and the Inter-American Court of Human Rights signed an agreement to established a network of institutions dedicated to this theme. The agreement was to include joint conferences and seminars, as well as interchange of officials, professional practices, research and publication.\\nAccording to a 2021 study of the impact of the museum on visitors, \\&quot;Chilean university students [who visit the museum subsequently] display greater support for democratic institutions, are more likely to reject institutions associated with the repressive period, and are more supportive of restorative transitional justice policies after visiting regardless of their ideological priors. We test for the persistence of these results and find that some of the effects endure for six months following the museum visit. We find support for the notion that emotional appeals deployed in the museum can shift citizen attitudes, which might have implications for processes of reconciliation.\\&quot;\\n&quot;, &quot;images&quot;: [&quot;https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/1/1d/Museo_de_la_memoria.JPG&quot;, &quot;https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/e/ea/Museo_memoria_sala_DDHH.JPG&quot;, &quot;https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/9/9a/Santiago_museo_de_la_memoria.jpg&quot;], &quot;near&quot;: [], &quot;lat&quot;: -70.6793861, &quot;lon&quot;: -33.4397361, &quot;maps&quot;: &quot;https://www.google.com/maps/search/?api=1&amp;query=Museo%20de%20la%20Memoria%20y%20Los%20Derechos%20Humanos%20Av.%20Matucana%20501%2C%208500000%20Santiago%2C%20Regi%C3%B3n%20Metropolitana%2C%20Chile&quot;, &quot;citymapper&quot;: &quot;https://citymapper.com/directions?endcoord=-33.4397361,-70.6793861&amp;endname=Museo%20de%20la%20Memoria%20y%20Los%20Derechos%20Humanos&quot;, &quot;icon&quot;: &quot;https://img.icons8.com/?size=150&amp;id=lAwJ42xa0VsG&quot;}\n",

The park was designed by the Chilean architect Teodoro Fern\\u00e1ndez after winning the official design competition in 1998, and the first phase opened its doors in 2007.\\n\\n\\n## History \\nThe Bicentennial Park is the result of the public competition called in 1998 by the City Council of Vitacura to establish a strategic plan that would organize the landscape and urban development of what was then known as the Parque de Las Am\\u00e9ricas (\\&quot;Park of the Americas\\&quot;), located on the banks of the Mapocho River.\\nThe winning proposal was led by Chilean architect Teodoro Fern\\u00e1ndez. Construction began in 2006, and it was inaugurated in two stages: the first, covering 18 hectares, was opened to the public in 2007. Then, in November 2011, the second and final phase was inaugurated, whose design was also led by the same architecture and landscaping team.\\nAfter its inauguration, the park became part of the network of public parks that extends continuously along the south bank of the Mapocho River, connecting the Parque de la Familia, Parque de Los Reyes, Parque Forestal, Parque Providencia, Parque Titanium and the Parque Monse\\u00f1or Escriv\\u00e1 de Balaguer.\\n\\n\\n## Features The park has at its central core the Civic Center of Vitacura, a complex that concentrates the public services of the namesake commune.

Libertador Bernardo O&#x27;Higgins, in Santiago de Chile. The complex was originally built to serve as the headquarters for the third UNCTAD conference, which was held in Santiago in 1972, and consisted of a convention center and an adjoining 22-stories building. The building was finished in only 275 days in a significant effort supported by several thousand volunteers. This effort was part of a major propaganda initiative performed by the socialist government of Salvador Allende, in power between the end of 1970 and September 1973 .After the conference, the building was used as a cultural center until the 1973 Chilean coup d&#x27;\\u00e9tat. After the end of the Pinochet regime, it hosted a number of conventions and the adjacent tower became the main building for the Ministry of National Defense. In early 2006, a fire destroyed parts of the building, which led the government of Michelle Bachelet to rethink the original sense of the building and return it into a cultural center, open to the public. Adapting the structure of its urban environment, the building takes on the concept of transparency and many artworks from the original design. The second phase that contains an auditorium with space for more than 2000 is going to start soon.\\nThe Centro Cultural Gabriela Mistral was inaugurated in September 2010 and is named after Chilean poet-diplomat, educator and humanist Gabriela Mistral.  Today it&#x27;s a cultural centre devoted to disseminate and promote performing arts and music. Among many other activities, it offers contemporary drama and dance, as well as classic and popular music, a space to continuous development and experimentation. Furthermore, with an emphasis on contemporary photography and popular arts, the GAM houses a range for visual arts. Due to its high demands for transparency, variety and quality, it is orientated to generate direct encounters between artists and diverse audiences.\\n&quot;, &quot;images&quot;: [&quot;https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/9/9d/2017_Santiago_de_Chile_-_Centro_Gabriela_Mistral_%28GAM%29%2C_avenida_Libertador_Bernardo_O%27Higgins_227.jpg&quot;], &quot;near&quot;: [], &quot;lat&quot;: -70.6398448, &quot;lon&quot;: -33.4391942, &quot;maps&quot;: &quot;https://www.google.com/maps/search/?api=1&amp;query=Centro%20Cultural%20Gabriela%20Mistral%20Av.%20Libertador%20Bernardo%20O%27Higgins%20227%2C%208320275%20Santiago%2C%20Regi%C3%B3n%20Metropolitana%2C%20Chile&quot;, &quot;citymapper&quot;: &quot;https://citymapper.com/directions?endcoord=-33.4391942,-70.6398448&amp;endname=Centro%20Cultural%20Gabriela%20Mistral&quot;, &quot;icon&quot;: &quot;https://img.icons8.com/?size=150&amp;id=lAwJ42xa0VsG&quot;}\n",

Falabella shopping malls subsidiary. It is headquartered in Santiago. The company manages shopping malls in Chile, Peru and Colombia. It has 24 shopping malls with a total of GLA 672,700 square meters.\\n\\n\\n## Company history The powerful Said clan in South America was founded by patriarch Isa Said, who immigrated to Peru from Jerusalem and made a fortune in commerce. His five sons contributed much towards the development of the textile industry in Peru and Bolivia, managing extensive cotton plantations and cotton-yarn factories. One of the five was Salvador, the father of nine children, including one son named Jos\\u00e9 Said Saffie. Jos\\u00e9 became involved in his extended family&#x27;s operations at an early age. During the 1940s, the Said family relocated to Chile to develop a textile industry there, and Jos\\u00e9 Said was an active participant in their first business, Industrias Qu\\u00edmicas Generales. In the 1960s, Jos\\u00e9 Said and his uncle founded Banco del Trabajo, which grew to be among the five largest banks in Chile.\\n\\n## Chilean projects during the 1980s =In 1979, Jos\\u00e9 Said founded Parque Arauco S.A. (PASA), a real estate development firm that was incorporated in 1981. The following year, he and his associates, who included Tom\\u00e1s F\\u00fcrst Freiwirth and the Mart\\u00ednez Perales brothers, opened the Parque Arauco Shopping Center in the Las Condes municipality of Santiago, which contained retail stores Gala-Sears and Muricy (later owned by Falabella and Almacenes Par\\u00eds, respectively). Since the mall adjoins at Kennedy Avenue (Avenida Kennedy), it is often referred to as Parque Arauco Kennedy to distinguish it from the corporation. Aided by an overvalued Chilean peso and an economic free trade policy, Chile was saturated with inexpensive foreign products when Parque Arauco Kennedy was inaugurated, and those who could afford to buy filled the new mall. However, the Chilean economy was falling into deep recession. Around the same time, the company introduced Arauco Outlet Mall in Santiago&#x27;s Maip\\u00fa municipality. This commercial center did not perform well and was later converted into a shopping mall.\\n\\n## 1990s =In 1997, PASA&#x27;s partners decided to divide their Chilean holdings. The Said group acquired F\\u00fcrst&#x27;s 12% holding and turned over to F\\u00fcrst its 14% share of Plaza Vespucio, which became the core property of F\\u00fcrst&#x27;s rival venture, Grupo Plaza (or Mall Plaza). The Said group now controlled 38% of PASA&#x27;s outstanding shares. The Abumohor family, also active in textiles and, like the Saids, of Arab origin, held 10%. Two pension funds held a combined 24%. Parque Arauco Kennedy was Chile&#x27;s largest shopping mall at the time, with annual sales of $500 million, while Plaza Vespucio ranked third, at $380 million. A medical tower was being constructed at Parque Arauco Kennedy, and an office building was being contemplated at a cost of $100 million. For Mall Arauco Maip\\u00fa, PASA was considering building an additional medical tower and a high-rise apartment building. In 1999, PASA, in partnership with the Almacenes Paris and Ripley retail chain, completed the Marina Arauco Mall in Vi\\u00f1a del Mar at a cost of $120 million. PASA malls accounted for 24% of Chile&#x27;s shopping-center revenues in that year.\\n\\n\\n## Entry into Argentina PASA entered Argentina in the early 1990s, when the nation was emerging from a decade of economic crisis. In 1992, the company acquired a 25% share of the Centro Comercial Mendoza Plaza Shopping and later became a major investor in Argentine real estate in association with Inversiones y Representaciones S.A. (IRSA). In 1994, IRSA and PASA became partners in Sociedad An\\u00f3nimo del Mercado de Abasto Provedor (Samap), a joint venture to convert the former produce market in Buenos Aires to a shopping mall. PASA donated its share of the Mendoza shopping center to Samap, while IRSA turned over its holding in Nuevo Noa Shopping, located in Salta City. In 1997, after Samap was renamed Alto Palermo S.A. (APSA), IRSA controlled 51%, while Parque Arauco controlled 35%.\\nIn 1997, Samap acquired Alto Palermo S.A. from the P\\u00e9rez Company S.A. holding company. APSA held three Buenos Aires shopping centers: Alto Palermo, Alto Avellaneda, and Paseo Alcorta, plus 50.5% of a fourth, Buenos Aires Design. Abasto Shopping Center was completed in 1998 at a cost of about $112 million. Located in Balvanera, a formerly Jewish barrio that was also the stamping grounds of Carlos Gardel, Argentina&#x27;s well-known tango dancer and singer, it occupied five levels, with 189 stores, a food court, a multiplex cinema, entertainment facilities, and a children&#x27;s museum.\\n\\n## Argentine recession =The 1998\\u20132002 Argentine great depression culminated in the government defaulting on its debt and the devaluation of the Argentine peso at the end of 2001. APSA&#x27;s market value declined from $390 million to as low as $40 million. The damage to PASA&#x27;s finances inspired a shakeup of the company&#x27;s management. In an interview with the new general manager, Andr\\u00e9s Olivos, for the Chilean magazine La Capital in 2003, reporter Lorena Medel contended that \\&quot;it was rumored that Parque Arauco had had a grade-10 earthquake. That its finances were delicate, and that shareholders couldn&#x27;t believe the level of debt that was permitted to arise with respect to Arauco Salud\\&quot; (the medical tower). Olivos denied the situation was ever as dire as some suspected and revealed that the company was opening a \\&quot;gastronomical boulevard\\&quot; for Parque Arauco Kennedy. He conceded that Arauco Maip\\u00fa had failed as an outlet store center and had returned to its role as a traditional mall.\\nOlivos acknowledged that PASA had fallen behind Grupo Plaza and Cencosud S.A. in commercial real estate development in Chile. \\&quot;Our strategy\\&quot;, he maintained, \\&quot;is distinct, and we believe that to enter this headlong race by adding square meters doesn&#x27;t necessarily add value. A good part of this growth only generates cannibalization, and many of the new investments won&#x27;t pay off in any foreseeable amount of time.\\&quot; Olivos said that PASA maintained a 32% market share in Santiago, with annual sales of roughly $200 million, and 20 million annual customers for Arauco Kennedy, 15 million for Arauco Maip\\u00fa, and 17 million for Marina Arauco. He added that the company had 45% of the mall market in Buenos Aires. Olivos revealed that PASA signed a contract with Arauco Salud&#x27;s new owners that would permit it to recover the $2.5 million debt incurred while constructing the 13-story tower. The company was also contemplating construction of a dental-office building in Arauco Kennedy. In addition, PASA completed its gastronomical boulevard during late 2003.\\n\\n## After the revival of the Argentine economy =With the revival of the Argentine economy well underway, PASA was planning new shopping malls in Rosario, Neuqu\\u00e9n, and Caballito, the latter two in collaboration with IRSA by means of APSA. Alto Rosario Shopping, completed in late 2004 in partnership with Coto Centro Integral de Comercializaci\\u00f3n S.A., was a conversion of an old railroad station within the original structure. APSA also had plans to enter C\\u00f3rdoba by purchasing land or acquiring one of three existing shopping centers. Sales from PASA properties were expected to reach $1.1 billion in 2004, with Argentina providing 38% of the total. All of APSA&#x27;s properties were at least 96% leased. PASA&#x27;s debt in Argentina was reduced from over $200 million in 2002 to about $28 million in 2003.\\n\\n\\n## Developments since 2005 In a 2005 article, La Capital proclaimed that PASA had \\&quot;woken up\\&quot;, with its three Chilean malls fully occupied, the success of Boulevard Gastron\\u00f3mico, a strong financial structure, many new projects for the next two years, and intentions to enter the retail market. The company was planning to construct 40 new Boulevard sites, a $20 million office real-estate project, remodel Arauco Maip\\u00fa, build, in alliance with the Almacenes Paris and Ripley, a new commercial center in Curic\\u00f3, and possibly financing retail businesses. He told the magazine, however, that the shopping mall market was saturated in Santiago and that PASA was not interested in entering \\&quot;the war for square meters.\\&quot; Indeed, he voiced his belief that only three or four malls in Chile generated enough business to justify the level of investment that had been made in them. In Argentina, besides participating in the construction of Alto Rosario, PASA was preparing to increase its stake in APSA from 27% to 32% with the impending conversion of $200 million in convertible bonds to common stock. In 2004, PASA reported net profits of CLP 7.56 billion on revenues of CLP 24.89 billion. The company&#x27;s long-term debt was CLP 101.92 billion at the end of 2004.\\n\\n\\n## Notes ==&quot;, &quot;images&quot;: [], &quot;near&quot;: [], &quot;lat&quot;: -70.7498986, &quot;lon&quot;: -33.4681598, &quot;maps&quot;: &quot;https://www.google.com/maps/search/?api=1&amp;query=Parque%20Arauco%20Parque%20Arauco%2C%20Maip%C3%BA%2C%20Regi%C3%B3n%20Metropolitana%2C%20Chile&quot;, &quot;citymapper&quot;: &quot;https://citymapper.com/directions?endcoord=-33.4681598,-70.7498986&amp;endname=Parque%20Arauco&quot;, &quot;icon&quot;: &quot;https://img.icons8.com/?size=150&amp;id=GkX1pWi41B1h&quot;}\n",

Owned by Cencosud, the complex consists of four skyscrapers, including the Gran Torre Santiago, two high-end hotels, an office building, and a six-floor shopping mall.\\nThe Gran Torre Santiago, which stands as the tallest of the four buildings, was designed by renowned architect C\\u00e9sar Pelli and measures 300 metres (980 ft) tall. It is the second tallest building in Latin America, following Torres Obispado, and the fifth tallest in the Southern Hemisphere, after Indonesia&#x27;s Autograph Tower and Luminary Tower in Jakarta and Australia&#x27;s Q1 on the Gold Coast and Australia 108 in Melbourne. One of the other buildings in the complex is 170 metres (560 ft) high, while the other is only four stories.\\nConstruction of the Costanera Center was temporarily halted in January 2009 due to the late 2000s recession. The developers were concerned that they would not be able to find tenants if completed by the originally proposed date. After the recession ended, Cencosud announced that construction would resume on December 16, 2009. The construction process restarted at the end of 2010.\\nOn February 14, 2012, the Gran Torre Santiago reached 300 meters and became the tallest building in South and Latin America. The mall in the complex, designed by Canadian retail agency Watt International, opened on June 12, 2012, and is the largest in South America. It comprises six floors and includes the Jumbo (hypermarket).\\n&quot;, &quot;images&quot;: [], &quot;near&quot;: [], &quot;lat&quot;: -70.6065351, &quot;lon&quot;: -33.4177448, &quot;maps&quot;: &quot;https://www.google.com/maps/search/?api=1&amp;query=Costanera%20Mall%20Av.%20Andr%C3%A9s%20Bello%202425%2C%207510689%20Providencia%2C%20Regi%C3%B3n%20Metropolitana%2C%20Chile&quot;, &quot;citymapper&quot;: &quot;https://citymapper.com/directions?endcoord=-33.4177448,-70.6065351&amp;endname=Costanera%20Mall&quot;, &quot;icon&quot;: &quot;https://img.icons8.com/?size=150&amp;id=GkX1pWi41B1h&quot;}\n",

Founded in 1988 by French entrepreneurs, it includes housing facilities along with around 900 hectares of skiing area.\\n\\n\\n## History The construction of the site began in 1987 and was completed the following year. This French-Chilean project was inspired by similar European resorts, especially Les Arcs in France. In 2001 the resort opened the first detachable chairlift in the region, gaining a significant advantage on its competitors.\\nFrom 2008 to 2010 important building projects have been realised in order to offer more housing to the tourists. One of the biggest among these projects is the construction of two buildings named Valle de los Condores.

The club&#x27;s nickname is \\&quot;Ruleteros\\&quot; or the roulette players in English, after Vi\\u00f1a del Mar&#x27;s status as a gambling resort.\\nEverton is Chile&#x27;s sixth most successful team, having won the national title 4 times, an achievement shared with both Audax Italiano and Magallanes. Additionally, it is the second most successful team outside Santiago de Chile, behind Cobreloa of Calama.\\nThe club&#x27;s home stadium is the 22,340 capacity Estadio Sausalito, while its biggest rival is Santiago Wanderers of Valpara\\u00edso. In the meetings between the two clubs, Everton have won 65 to 49 losses.\\n\\n\\n## History \\n## Foundation and Amateur Era =On 24 June 1909, a group of immigrants from England, led by David Foxley, founded Everton Football Club in Cerro Alegre of Valpara\\u00edso. The choice of this name is still to this day a mystery, although there are various competing theories. The most accepted theory is that this was chosen in honour of the namesake club in the city of Liverpool, which was, by then, touring Argentina. Another theory states the name of a toffee at the time. The first president was Francisco Boundy, while David Foxley was appointed honorary chairman. In 1950 the club was renamed Everton de Vi\\u00f1a del Mar.\\nThe first match played was against Graphie FC with the starting lineup composed of Arturo Foxley as the goalkeeper, Percy Holmes and Francisco Boundy as the defenders; Alberto Gonz\\u00e1lez, Hugo Boundy and Carlos Gonz\\u00e1lez as the midfielders and finally J. Escobar, A. Aravena, David Foxley, V. Estay and Malcolm Fraser as the strikers.\\nOriginally the club was a compendium of different sports, the most important being track and field, human swimming, badminton, rugby, gymnastics, basketball and football.\\nEverton&#x27;s first championship participation was the 1912 amateur championship of the Liga de Valpara\\u00edso.\\n\\n## The Golden age Everton&#x27;s first championship win was in 1950 under the Argentine coach Mart\\u00edn Garc\\u00eda. They defeated Uni\\u00f3n Espa\\u00f1ola 1\\u20130 away in a play-off on 14 January 1951. The lone goal was scored by Ren\\u00e9 Mel\\u00e9ndez in the Estadio Nacional de Chile before 45,000 spectators.\\nIn 1951, Everton finished the league in fourth, 5 points behind Audax Italiano. The following year, Everton clinched the Primera Divisi\\u00f3n with two weeks to spare, as Mart\\u00edn Garc\\u00eda&#x27;s side beat Audax Italiano 4\\u20130 at home win. In the championship-winning squad the most prominent players were Jos\\u00e9 Mar\\u00eda Lourido, El\\u00edas Cid and Ren\\u00e9 Mel\\u00e9ndez, top-scorer of the tournament with 30 goals. During this period the club also won against important clubs of South America, the most recorded match was against the Argentine club Independiente of Avellaneda, in a 5\\u20130 home win at Estadio El Tranque with 12,000 spectators.\\nThe performance of the club began to decline, and apart from a third-place finish in 1955, Everton&#x27;s highest finish for the remainder of the 1950s would be sixth position in the 12-team league.\\n\\n## 1970-present =After many years of revolving between the Primera Divisi\\u00f3n and the 2nd tier the club finally clinched their third Primera Divisi\\u00f3n championship in the 1976 Primera Divisi\\u00f3n under the guidance of manager Pedro Morales. They have won the 2nd division championship on two occasions, the first in 1974 and most recently in 2003. The club has played in 2 Copa Libertadores tournaments, the first came in 1977 after their Primera Divisi\\u00f3n 1976 championship.\\nIn Torneo Apertura 2007 the club ended in 12th position, but in the Torneo Clausura the club made the worst campaign in its history ended in last position (21st).\\nIn the Torneo Apertura 2008 Everton was proclaimed champion of the tournament, with a 3\\u20132 aggregate result against Colo-Colo in Estadio Sausalito. In the first leg Everton lost 2\\u20130 away at the Estadio Monumental David Arellano with goals by Lucas Barrios and Gonzalo Fierro but in the second home leg at the Estadio Sausalito Everton won 3\\u20130 with two goals by Ezequiel Miralles and one from Jaime Riveros. In thanks to that tournament win in 2009 Everton qualified for the Copa Libertadotes, for the second time in their history.\\nOn 4 August 2010 at Goodison Park in Liverpool England, Everton de Vi\\u00f1a del Mar for the first time played the club they were named in honour of, their namesakes Everton. In a friendly match for the Copa Hermandad (known in English as the Brotherhood Trophy), the match was to promote closer ties between the two Evertons. The match was won 2\\u20130 by the original Everton with goals from Jermaine Beckford and Diniyar Bilyaletdinov. That year Everton de Vi\\u00f1a, were relegated to Primera B.\\nTwo seasons later, Everton de Vi\\u00f1a featured in the Primera B promotion play-off against Universidad de Concepci\\u00f3n, winning the first (home) leg on 18 November 2012 (1\\u20130) with a goal from Angel Rojas. In the away leg on 26 November 2012 two goals from Jos\\u00e9 Luis Mu\\u00f1oz and one from Yonathan Suazo secured a 1\\u20133 win and a return to the top-flight of Chilean football in 2013.\\n\\n\\n## Rivalries Everton&#x27;s main rivals are Santiago Wanderers, from the nearby city of Valpara\\u00edso. Valpara\\u00edso is seen as a historical city with rich culture, home of worldwide known poet Pablo Neruda, whilst Vi\\u00f1a del Mar is renowned for being a glamorous and luxurious place full of resorts. The local derby is dubbed the \\&quot;Cl\\u00e1sico Porte\\u00f1o\\&quot; or \\&quot;The Seaport Derby\\&quot; in English.\\n\\n\\n## Stadium \\nThe club&#x27;s home games are played at the Estadio Sausalito, which has a capacity of 22,340 seats being built in 1929. The name comes from the nearby lagoon Sausalito. The stadium was used as one of the venues for the 1962 FIFA World Cup. The stadium hosted the semi-final between Czechoslovakia and Yugoslavia. It was also one of four venues to host matches during the 1991 Copa Am\\u00e9rica and 2015 Copa Am\\u00e9rica.\\n\\n\\n## Honours Primera Divisi\\u00f3n: 4\\n1950, 1952, 1976, 2008 Apertura\\nCopa Chile: 1\\n1984\\nPrimera B: 1\\n2003\\nCopa Apertura Segunda Divisi\\u00f3n: 1\\n1982\\nPrimera B Clausura: 1\\n2011\\nSecci\\u00f3n Profesional de Vi\\u00f1a del Mar: 1\\n1944\\n\\n\\n## Club facts 67 Seasons in Primera Divisi\\u00f3n\\n14 Seasons in Primera B\\n3 Participations in Copa Libertadores (1977, 2009, 2022)\\n3 Participations in Copa Sudamericana (2017, 2018, 2022)\\n\\n\\n## South American cups history \\n\\n## Records Record Primera Divisi\\u00f3n victory \\u2014 7\\u20130 v.

It was founded during the 1930s, nestled in a small valley in the Andes mountains close to other ski areas such as Valle Nevado, La Parva, and El Colorado.\\n\\n\\n## Location \\nLocated in the commune of Lo Barnechea, 36 km from Santiago at an altitude of 2,340 meters above sea level (7,874 feet), Farellones has a health centre, a school, and about 200 houses. The houses and cabins are made of wood, giving the village its characteristic look.\\n\\n\\n## Ski resort Skiers began visiting the Farellones area in the 1930s and in 1937, landowner Von Kiesling decided to sell the land off as plots to form a village. Not long after this, Antonio Padr\\u00f3s opened one of Farellones\\u2019 first hotels, the Posada de Farellones.\\nFarellones currently has only a few ski runs but its cable car system provides access to El Colorado, located only five kilometres up the hill of the same name. They are often considered as one joint ski area with a total of 62 runs including 11 for beginners, 6 for intermediates, 33 for advanced skiers, and 12 for experts. They have a maximum altitude of 3,333 meters above sea level, a vertical descent of 906 metres, and an average of 5 meters of snowfall in an average year. They are popular with beginners and families.\\n\\n\\n## History of skiing in Farellones Skiing began in Farellones in the early 1930s, when ski gear came to Chile for the first time from Switzerland and Norway, consisting of wooden skis, leather boots coated in colourless grease to keep out the wet, with basic and dangerous bindings that remained fixed to the feet even during a fall.\\nThe village grew up around the new sport and in 1937, the Hotel Posada de Farellones was constructed. Some years later the hotel received a royal visit from the English Duchess of Kent and served a formal luncheon. The first ski lift was built in the 1950s in La Gran Bajada (the great descent) in the area that would become later El Colorado, where the boldest skiers could leap over the roof of the Hotel Posada de Farellones at the end of the run.\\nThe developments continued up the mountain with La Parva and finally Valle Nevado.\\n\\n\\n## Archaeology \\nLong time before the birth of Farellones village, the place was visited by arrieros (wranglers) with their livestock and adventurers searching for old Inca treasure, as it was common to find Pucar\\u00e1s (fortifications) and other remains of Inca settlements.\\nOn February 1, 1954, the arrieros Luis R\\u00edos Barrueto, Guillermo Chac\\u00f3n Carrasco,and Jaime R\\u00edos Abarca found the Plomo Mummy (also known as the Boy of El Plomo or La Momia del Cerro El Plomo in Spanish) on Cerro El Plomo. The mummy is a well preserved Inca girl  and was the first discovery of a frozen, high-altitude human sacrifice made by the Incas.\\n\\n## Casa de Piedra =At one side of the road to Valle Nevado is the Casa de Piedra de Farellones (Farellones Stone House), a stone structure that is believed to have been built by the Aconcagua people (late neolithic). It is thought to have been used as a temporary refuge in expeditions to gather the special kind of stone needed for making tools hunting Guanacos.\\n\\n## Inca roads Corral Quemado, 28.75 km east of Santiago and 14.5 miles from Lo Barnechea, formed part of the Inca road system. It was the road from the copper mines, today known as \\&quot;Disputada de las Condes\\&quot;, to the Mapocho River. The Inca road system was the spine of the Inca state, essential to administrate and control their vast territory.\\nThe Spanish chronicles say that the Inca Road ran from the other side of the Andes, in Cuyo Province, Argentina, through Chilean valleys of Huechuraba and Colina  and continued to the valley of what is now Santiago.\\n\\n\\n## The hotel The Hotel Posada de Farellones is made from a mix of wood and stone in the Swiss style and was built in the late 1930s by Antonio Padr\\u00f3s.  Its location allowed easy access to the three main ski resorts in Chile, which together form the biggest ski area of South America and the southern hemisphere: La Parva, El Colorado-Farellones and Valle Nevado.\\n\\n\\n## Access There is only one road giving access to the village through the winding canyons of the Mapocho River, Molina River and Estero Yerba Loca river. From Corral Quemado onwards, the road has more than 40 hairpin turns and requires a vehicle equipped with snow chains in snowy conditions. The road only permits ascent between the hours of 8:30 and 13:30 and descent from 15:30 to 20:00 during peak ski season days.\\n\\n## New road =A new road was scheduled to be built in 2014. The road would run for 29 kilometers from Las Condes Avenue in Santiago, and would also see the construction of new real estate and a cable cart from Yerba Loca Nature Sanctuary to Farellones village.\\n\\n\\n## Yerba Loca Nature Sanctuary Yerba Loca Nature Sanctuary (Spanish: \\&quot;Santuario Natural Yerba Loca\\&quot;) is a protected area that extends from the top of La Paloma Hill (Spanish: \\&quot;Cerro La Paloma\\&quot;) to the top of Cerro El Plomo, dividing the valleys of the Blanco River and Olivares River.\\nThe area contains temperate coniferous forest, picnic and camping facilities, and the starting point for five trails, one of which ends at the hanging glaciers of Cerro La Paloma and Cerro El Altar.\\n\\n\\n## Incident On July 14, 2016, Matilda Rapaport, a Swedish professional extreme skier, was buried in an avalanche. She died on July 18, 2016, in a hospital in Santiago after suffering oxygen deprivation and brain damage.\\n&quot;, &quot;images&quot;: [&quot;https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/b/bd/Farellones.jpg&quot;, &quot;https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/8/8d/Farellones_Panor%C3%A1mica.jpg&quot;, &quot;https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/d/d1/Season_finish.JPG&quot;], &quot;near&quot;: [], &quot;lat&quot;: -70.6544261, &quot;lon&quot;: -33.5830201, &quot;maps&quot;: &quot;https://www.google.com/maps/search/?api=1&amp;query=Farellones%20Farellones%2C%20La%20Pintana%2C%20Regi%C3%B3n%20Metropolitana%2C%20Chile&quot;, &quot;citymapper&quot;: &quot;https://citymapper.com/directions?endcoord=-33.5830201,-70.6544261&amp;endname=Farellones&quot;, &quot;icon&quot;: &quot;https://img.icons8.com/?size=150&amp;id=GOJ9vneGe3dU&quot;}\n",

Valpara\\u00edso was named originally for Valpara\\u00edso de Arriba, in Castile-La Mancha, Spain. It is located about 120 km (75 mi) northwest of Santiago, by road, and is one of the Pacific Ocean&#x27;s most important seaports. Valpara\\u00edso is the capital of Chile&#x27;s second most-populated administrative region and has been the  Chilean Navy headquarters since 1817, as well as being the seat of the Chilean National Congress (since 1990). \\nValpara\\u00edso played an important geopolitical role in the second half of the 19th century when it served as a major stopover for ships traveling between the Atlantic and Pacific oceans via  the Straits of Magellan. The area experienced rapid growth during its golden age as a magnet for European immigrants, when the city was known by international sailors as \\&quot;Little San Francisco\\&quot; and \\&quot;jewel of the Pacific\\&quot;. Notable acquisitions from this golden age include Latin America&#x27;s oldest stock exchange, the continent&#x27;s first volunteer fire department, Chile&#x27;s first public library, and the oldest Spanish language newspaper in continuous publication in the world, El Mercurio de Valpara\\u00edso. In 2003, the historic quarter of Valpara\\u00edso was declared a UNESCO World Heritage Site.\\nThe twentieth century was unfavorable to Valpara\\u00edso, as many wealthy families abandoned the city. The opening of the Panama Canal in 1914, and the associated reduction in ship traffic, dealt a serious blow to the region&#x27;s shipping- and port-based economy. By the 21st century, the port of San Antonio had surpassed Valpara\\u00edso in trade volume (TEU) handled, leading to the questioning of its traditional moniker of Puerto Principal (\\&quot;principal port\\&quot;) of Chile. \\nBetween the years of 2000 to 2015, the city experienced a recovery, attracting artists, tourists, and cultural entrepreneurs, who settled after they were attracted by the city&#x27;s hillside historic districts. Today, many thousands of people visit Valpara\\u00edso each month, from Chile and abroad, to enjoy the city&#x27;s labyrinth of cobbled alleys and colorful buildings. The Port of Valpara\\u00edso still continues to be a major distribution center for container traffic, copper, and fruit exports. It also receives growing attention from cruise ships that visit during the South American summer. Most significantly, Valpara\\u00edso has transformed itself into a major educational and entertainment hub, with four large traditional universities, and several large vocational colleges. \\nWhile the city is well-known for its artisans and bohemian culture, it is also famous as the home of several highly-regarded music festivals and other artistic events. The largest, and arguably most iconic, is the annual Vi\\u00f1a Del Mar International Song Festival (often simply called \\&quot;Vi\\u00f1a\\&quot; or \\&quot;Vi\\u00f1a Del Mar\\&quot;). Typically held in March, in a recently-refurbished, 40,000-capacity amphitheater, \\&quot;Vi\\u00f1a\\&quot; is one of the biggest annual economic boosts to the region, as the event usually sells-out completely, and thousands of attendees and workers will travel to and stay in the city and metro area. In addition to showcasing numerous performers of many styles, and awarding various prizes, the internationally-televised and live-streamed festival is typically headlined by superstar musicians, from both the Spanish- and English-speaking worlds.\\n\\n\\n## History \\nSome older works starting with Benjam\\u00edn Vicu\\u00f1a Mackenna (1869) claim that Valpara\\u00edso was within the range of the Chango people, but clear evidence for this is lacking.\\nThe Bay of Valpara\\u00edso&#x27;s first ethnically identifiable population were Picunche natives, known for their agriculture. Spanish explorers, considered the first European discoverers of Chile, arrived in 1536, aboard the Santiaguillo, a supply ship sent by Diego de Almagro. The Santiaguillo carried men and supplies for Almagro&#x27;s expedition, under the command of Juan de Saavedra, who named the town after his native village of Valpara\\u00edso de Arriba in Cuenca Province, Spain.\\n\\nDuring Spanish colonial times, Valpara\\u00edso remained a small village, with only a few houses and a church. On some occasions she was attacked by English pirates and privateers, such as Francis Drake with his ship Golden Hind in 1578 and later his cousin Richard Hawkins with his ship Dainty in 1594. Drake&#x27;s sack of Valpara\\u00edso gave origin to the legend about Cueva del Pirata.\\n\\nIn 1810, a wealthy merchant built the first pier in the history of Chile and the first during the colonial era. In its place today, stands the building of El Mercurio de Valpara\\u00edso. The ocean then rose to this point. Reclamation of land from the sea moved the coastline five blocks away. Between 1810 and 1830, he built much of the existing port of the city, including much of the land reclamation work that now comprises the city&#x27;s commercial centre. \\nIn 1814, the naval Battle of Valpara\\u00edso was fought offshore of the town, between American and British ships involved in the War of 1812. After Chile&#x27;s independence from Spain (1818), beginning the Republican Era, Valpara\\u00edso became the main harbour for the nascent Chilean navy, and opened international trade opportunities that had been formerly limited to Spain and its other colonies.\\n\\nValpara\\u00edso soon became a desired stopover for ships rounding South America via the Straits of Magellan and Cape Horn. It gained particular importance supporting and supplying the California Gold Rush (1848\\u20131858). As a major seaport, Valpara\\u00edso received immigrants from many European countries, mainly from Britain, Germany, France, Switzerland and Italy. German, French, Italian and English were commonly spoken among its citizens, who founded and published newspapers in these languages.\\nValpara\\u00edso found maritime competition with Callao (Per\\u00fa). Both cities sought to be the dominant port on the Pacific Coast of South America during the period of time known as the High Trade (1880\\u20131930). \\nThe British community, La Colonia Britanica, prospered in Valpara\\u00edso between the 1820s and 1920s. Firms such as Antony Gibbs &amp; Sons, Duncan Fox, and Williamson-Balfour Company were doing business in the town, which had become a significant trading center by 1840, with 166 British ships, out of a total of 287, anchored in its port. The British settled on Cerro Alegre (Mount Pleasant) and Cerro Concepci\\u00f3n. The Association of Voluntary Firemen was created in 1851, a telegraph service to Santiago was operating by 1852, and Chile&#x27;s first telephone service was set up in 1880. The British Hospital was founded in 1897, and the British Arch, Arco Brit\\u00e1nico, was erected in 1911. However, by 1895, Italian immigrants exceeded the British, and both the Italians and Germans were in larger numbers by 1907. By 1920, both the Italians and Spanish outnumbered the British, and the primary British community within Chile resided in Santiago. \\n\\nInternational immigration transformed the local culture from Spanish origins and Amerindian origins, in ways that included the construction of the first non-Catholic cemetery of Chile, the Dissidents&#x27; Cemetery. Football (soccer) was introduced to Chile by English immigrants; and the first private Catholic school in Chile, Le Coll\\u00e8ge des Sacr\\u00e9s C\\u0153urs (\\&quot;Sacred Hearts College\\&quot;) and its accompanying Sacred Hearts Church, by French immigrants. Immigrants from Scotland and Germany founded the first private secular schools (The Mackay School and Die Deutsche Schule, respectively). Immigrants formed the first volunteer fire-fighting units (still a volunteer activity in Chile). Their buildings reflected a variety of European styles, making Valpara\\u00edso more varied than some other Chilean cities.\\nOn 18 August 1906, a major earthquake struck Valpara\\u00edso; there was extensive property damage and thousands of deaths. The Chilean doctor, Carlos Van Buren, of U.S. descent, was involved in the medical care of earthquake victims. He later established the Hospital  Carlos Van Buren in 1912.\\nThe golden age of Valpara\\u00edso&#x27;s commerce ended after the opening of the Panama Canal in 1914. Shipping shifted to the canal as captains sought to avoid the risks of the Strait of Magellan. The port&#x27;s use and traffic declined significantly, causing a decline in the city&#x27;s economy. The opening of the Panama Canal was one of the most critical events in the shaping of Valpara\\u00edo&#x27;s economy. Since the turn of the 21st century, shipping has increased in the last few decades with fruit exports, opening the Chilean economy to world commerce, and larger-scale, Post-Panamax ships that do not fit the Panama Canal.\\n\\n## 19th century On 28 March 1814, the USS Essex was defeated by British frigates Phoebe and Cherub during the War of 1812, leading to the deaths of 58 US Marines. Captain David Porter, a survivor of this attack, would retire to Portersville, Indiana, and request changing the name to Valparaiso, commemorating the only naval battle he ever lost. By 2 August 1820, the Liberating Expedition of Peru sailed from Valpara\\u00edso.\\nAt 10:30 pm on the evening of 19 November 1822, Valpara\\u00edso experienced a violent earthquake that left the city in ruins; of the 16,000 residents, casualties included at least 66 adults and 12 children, as well as 110 people wounded. The next day, a meteor trail was visible from Quillota to Valpara\\u00edso, seen as a religious experience for much of the population.\\nIn 1826, the Royal Navy Great Britain established a South America Station in Valpara\\u00edso to maintain British naval interest in the region. It would remain until 1837, when it was relocated to Esquimalt, British Columbia. 12 September 1827 saw the establishment of El Mercurio de Valpara\\u00edso, the oldest circulating newspaper in the Spanish language worldwide.\\nIn May 1828, a constitutional convention began regular meetings in the church of San Francisco. By August 9, the Constitution of the Republic of Chile was fully drafted and disseminated.\\nOn 6 June 1837, Minister Diego Portales was shot at the port outside of Baron Hill on suspicion of promoting conspirators who opposed the Peru-Bolivian Confederation, considered a turning point of Chilean public opinion and the purpose of the war.\\nBy 1851, the first fire brigade in the country was formed. The next year potable running water became available, as well as the first telegraph service in Latin America, between the city and Santiago. It would be another four years before streetlights, with 700 gas lanterns, were installed. In 1861 the first tram company was formed, mostly using horses or mules to draw them, and fully established over the next few years.\\nIn 1852, British shipping company Williamson, Balfour &amp; C\\u00eda was established in Valpara\\u00edso to handle trade in the region. \\nTaking advantage of the total lack of defenses, a Spanish fleet commanded by Casto M\\u00e9ndez N\\u00fa\\u00f1ez bombarded the city during the Chincha Islands War in 1866. Chilean merchant ships were sunk, except for those vessels whose captains hoisted foreign flags.\\nA merger of the National Steamship Company and Chilean Steamship Company, the South American Steamship Company was created as a national response to the increasing dominance of the Pacific Steam Navigation Company in 1872. In 1880 the Chilean Telephone Company was formed by Americans Joseph Husbands, Peter MacKellar, James Martin, and the US consul Lucius Foot, the first official telephone company in the country. Three years later on the first of December, Concepci\\u00f3n funicular opened, the first of many hydraulic systems. After the country&#x27;s independence and its consequent openness to international trade, Valpara\\u00edso became an important port of call on trade routes through the Eastern Pacific. Many immigrants settled there, mostly from Europe and North America, who helped include Valpara\\u00edso and Chile in the Industrial Revolution sweeping other parts of the world. This created a different city with civil, financial, commercial and industrial institutions, many of which still exist today.\\nAll this resulted in a population increases. The city reached more than 160,000 inhabitants in the late nineteenth century, making it necessary to use the steep hills for more houses, mansions and even cemeteries. The lack of available land caused the city authorities and developers to reclaim low lying tidal marshland (polders) upon which to build administrative, commercial and industrial infrastructure.\\n\\n## 20th century The twentieth century began with the first big protest of dockworkers, Chile on 15 April 1903, due to complaints by dockers about their excessive working hours and demands for higher wages, requests that were ignored by employers, creating a tense situation that led to serious violence on 12 May. There were protests and the burning of the CSAV offices and several people were shot and killed. All this prompted intervention by the state. This protest was important for the future of Trade Unionism in the country.\\nThat same year, electric trams were introduced.\\nThe 1906 Valpara\\u00edso earthquake caused severe damage throughout the city on 16 August, which was at that time the heart of the Chilean economy. The damage was valued at hundreds of millions of pesos of the time, and human victims were counted at 3,000 dead and over 20,000 injured. After the removal of the debris, reconstruction work began. This included the widening of streets, culverting and covering streams, (Jaime and Delicias \\u2013 creating the avenues Francia and Argentina respectively). The main street of the city (Pedro Montt) was laid and Plaza O&#x27;Higgins was created; a hill was removed to allow the passage of Colon Street. The damaged Edwards mansion was demolished and in its place, the present Cathedral of Valpara\\u00edso was built and, among many other works, this gave shape to the Almendral Valpara\\u00edso area.\\nIn 1910, the port expansion work of the city, which ended in 1930, began. A long breakwater was built, along with piers and docking terminals.\\nThe Imperial German East Asia Squadron engaged the British West Indies Squadron on 1 November 1914 at the Battle of Coronel off the coast of Valparaiso, sinking two British cruisers. After the battle the East Asia Squadron stayed in Valparaiso Harbor before continuing to the Falklands.\\n\\n## 21st century Chile&#x27;s legislature along with other institutions of national importance like the National Customs Service, the National Fish and Aquaculture Ministry, the Ministry of Culture and the Barracks General of the Chilean Navy are sited in the city. In addition to the capital of the Valpara\\u00edso Region hosts the Regional Administration and government.\\nIn 2003, Valpara\\u00edso became an UNESCO World Heritage Centre. This title was awarded to Valparaiso for its unique urban form, as well as its clear maintained historical background as a colorful port city. In becoming a World Heritage Center, Valpara\\u00edso is tasked with maintaining its cultural heritage, through the maintenance of its historic infrastructure, like its Ascensores.\\nOn 13 April 2014, a huge brush fire burned out of control, destroying 2,800 homes and killing 16 people, forcing President Michelle Bachelet to declare it a disaster zone.\\nIn early February 2024, a huge brush fire burned through Valparaiso and central Chile, killing at least 131 people.\\n\\n\\n## Geography \\nValpara\\u00edso is located in central Chile, 120 km (75 mi) to the north west of the capital Santiago. Valpara\\u00edso, like most of Chile, is vulnerable to earthquakes. Before the earthquake of February 27, 2010, which measured 8.8 on the moment magnitude scale, the last catastrophic earthquake to strike Valpara\\u00edso devastated the city in August 1906, killing nearly 3,000 people. Other significant earthquakes to affect the city were the 1730 Valpara\\u00edso earthquake and the 1985 Algarrobo earthquake.\\n\\n## Geology =Because of Valpara\\u00edso&#x27;s proximity to the Peru\\u2013Chile Trench, the city is vulnerable to earthquakes. The Peru\\u2013Chile Trench stores large amounts of energy for a very long time and sometimes ruptures after short intervals in a violent earthquake.\\n\\n## Climate =Valpara\\u00edso has a very mild Mediterranean climate (K\\u00f6ppen Csb). The summer is essentially dry, but the city is affected by fogs from the Humboldt Current during most of the year. In the winter, rainfall can occasionally be extremely heavy when a powerful frontal system crosses central Chile, but frequency of such rains varies greatly from year to year. Monthly average temperatures vary just around 6\\u00b0C between the coolest and the warmest month, from 17 \\u00b0C (63 \\u00b0F) in January to 11.4 \\u00b0C (52.5 \\u00b0F) in July. Snowfall occurs rarely in the highest parts of the city. In winter, strong winds can lead to wind chill temperatures below freezing.\\n\\n\\n## Cityscape \\nNicknamed \\&quot;The Jewel of the Pacific\\&quot;, Valpara\\u00edso was declared a world heritage site based upon its improvised urban design and unique architecture. In 1996, the World Monuments Fund declared Valpara\\u00edso&#x27;s unusual system of funicular lifts (steeply inclined carriages) one of the world&#x27;s 100 most endangered historical treasures. In 1998, grassroots activists convinced the Chilean government and local authorities to apply for UNESCO world heritage status for Valpara\\u00edso. Valpara\\u00edso was declared a World Heritage Site in 2003. Built upon dozens of steep hillsides overlooking the Pacific Ocean, Valpara\\u00edso has a labyrinth of streets and cobblestone alleyways, embodying a rich architectural and cultural legacy. Valpara\\u00edso is protected as a UNESCO World Heritage Site.\\nSince its status as a World Heritage Site, Valpara\\u00edso has made several changes to its urban fabric in the process of maintaining its cultural heritage.\\nLandmarks include:\\n\\nIglesia de la Matriz\\nPlaza An\\u00edbal Pinto\\nPlaza Sotomayor including the Edificio Armada de Chile\\nEdificio Luis Cousi\\u00f1o\\nCourthouse\\n16 remaining funiculars (called ascensores): 15 public (national monuments) and 1 private (which belongs to \\&quot;Hospital Carlos Van Buren\\&quot;).\\nThe Concepcion and Alegre historical district\\nThe Bellavista hill, which has the \\&quot;Museo a Cielo Abierto\\&quot; or \\&quot;open air museum\\&quot;\\nMonument to Admiral Lord Thomas Alexander Cochrane, 10th Earl of Dundonald\\nMonument to Manuel Blanco Encalada, first Chilean President\\nCapilla del Carmen\\nCemeteries on Pante\\u00f3n Hill \\u2013 Cemetery Number One (Catholic) and Dissidents Cemetery (Protestant)\\n=&quot;, &quot;images&quot;: [&quot;https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/7/79/Arco_Brit%C3%A1nico.jpg&quot;, &quot;https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/4/4e/Ascensor_Artilleria_Valpara%C3%ADso.JPG&quot;, &quot;https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/3/32/Ascensor_Artiller%C3%ADa.jpg&quot;, &quot;https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/9/90/Ascensor_Conception-_Built_in_1883.jpg&quot;], &quot;near&quot;: [], &quot;lat&quot;: -71.6306301, &quot;lon&quot;: -33.0332511, &quot;maps&quot;: &quot;https://www.google.com/maps/search/?api=1&amp;query=Ascensor%20Artilleria%20Artiller%C3%ADa%2C%20Valpara%C3%ADso%2C%20Chile&quot;, &quot;citymapper&quot;: &quot;https://citymapper.com/directions?endcoord=-33.0332511,-71.6306301&amp;endname=Ascensor%20Artilleria&quot;, &quot;icon&quot;: &quot;https://img.icons8.com/?size=150&amp;id=dSop1JRmi76I&quot;}\n",

Valpara\\u00edso was named originally for Valpara\\u00edso de Arriba, in Castile-La Mancha, Spain. It is located about 120 km (75 mi) northwest of Santiago, by road, and is one of the Pacific Ocean&#x27;s most important seaports. Valpara\\u00edso is the capital of Chile&#x27;s second most-populated administrative region and has been the  Chilean Navy headquarters since 1817, as well as being the seat of the Chilean National Congress (since 1990). \\nValpara\\u00edso played an important geopolitical role in the second half of the 19th century when it served as a major stopover for ships traveling between the Atlantic and Pacific oceans via  the Straits of Magellan. The area experienced rapid growth during its golden age as a magnet for European immigrants, when the city was known by international sailors as \\&quot;Little San Francisco\\&quot; and \\&quot;jewel of the Pacific\\&quot;. Notable acquisitions from this golden age include Latin America&#x27;s oldest stock exchange, the continent&#x27;s first volunteer fire department, Chile&#x27;s first public library, and the oldest Spanish language newspaper in continuous publication in the world, El Mercurio de Valpara\\u00edso. In 2003, the historic quarter of Valpara\\u00edso was declared a UNESCO World Heritage Site.\\nThe twentieth century was unfavorable to Valpara\\u00edso, as many wealthy families abandoned the city.

Three years later on the first of December, Concepci\\u00f3n funicular opened, the first of many hydraulic systems. After the country&#x27;s independence and its consequent openness to international trade, Valpara\\u00edso became an important port of call on trade routes through the Eastern Pacific. Many immigrants settled there, mostly from Europe and North America, who helped include Valpara\\u00edso and Chile in the Industrial Revolution sweeping other parts of the world. This created a different city with civil, financial, commercial and industrial institutions, many of which still exist today.\\nAll this resulted in a population increases. The city reached more than 160,000 inhabitants in the late nineteenth century, making it necessary to use the steep hills for more houses, mansions and even cemeteries. The lack of available land caused the city authorities and developers to reclaim low lying tidal marshland (polders) upon which to build administrative, commercial and industrial infrastructure.\\n\\n## 20th century The twentieth century began with the first big protest of dockworkers, Chile on 15 April 1903, due to complaints by dockers about their excessive working hours and demands for higher wages, requests that were ignored by employers, creating a tense situation that led to serious violence on 12 May. There were protests and the burning of the CSAV offices and several people were shot and killed. All this prompted intervention by the state. This protest was important for the future of Trade Unionism in the country.\\nThat same year, electric trams were introduced.\\nThe 1906 Valpara\\u00edso earthquake caused severe damage throughout the city on 16 August, which was at that time the heart of the Chilean economy. The damage was valued at hundreds of millions of pesos of the time, and human victims were counted at 3,000 dead and over 20,000 injured. After the removal of the debris, reconstruction work began. This included the widening of streets, culverting and covering streams, (Jaime and Delicias \\u2013 creating the avenues Francia and Argentina respectively). The main street of the city (Pedro Montt) was laid and Plaza O&#x27;Higgins was created; a hill was removed to allow the passage of Colon Street. The damaged Edwards mansion was demolished and in its place, the present Cathedral of Valpara\\u00edso was built and, among many other works, this gave shape to the Almendral Valpara\\u00edso area.\\nIn 1910, the port expansion work of the city, which ended in 1930, began. A long breakwater was built, along with piers and docking terminals.\\nThe Imperial German East Asia Squadron engaged the British West Indies Squadron on 1 November 1914 at the Battle of Coronel off the coast of Valparaiso, sinking two British cruisers. After the battle the East Asia Squadron stayed in Valparaiso Harbor before continuing to the Falklands.\\n\\n## 21st century Chile&#x27;s legislature along with other institutions of national importance like the National Customs Service, the National Fish and Aquaculture Ministry, the Ministry of Culture and the Barracks General of the Chilean Navy are sited in the city. In addition to the capital of the Valpara\\u00edso Region hosts the Regional Administration and government.\\nIn 2003, Valpara\\u00edso became an UNESCO World Heritage Centre. This title was awarded to Valparaiso for its unique urban form, as well as its clear maintained historical background as a colorful port city. In becoming a World Heritage Center, Valpara\\u00edso is tasked with maintaining its cultural heritage, through the maintenance of its historic infrastructure, like its Ascensores.\\nOn 13 April 2014, a huge brush fire burned out of control, destroying 2,800 homes and killing 16 people, forcing President Michelle Bachelet to declare it a disaster zone.\\nIn early February 2024, a huge brush fire burned through Valparaiso and central Chile, killing at least 131 people.\\n\\n\\n## Geography \\nValpara\\u00edso is located in central Chile, 120 km (75 mi) to the north west of the capital Santiago. Valpara\\u00edso, like most of Chile, is vulnerable to earthquakes. Before the earthquake of February 27, 2010, which measured 8.8 on the moment magnitude scale, the last catastrophic earthquake to strike Valpara\\u00edso devastated the city in August 1906, killing nearly 3,000 people. Other significant earthquakes to affect the city were the 1730 Valpara\\u00edso earthquake and the 1985 Algarrobo earthquake.\\n\\n## Geology =Because of Valpara\\u00edso&#x27;s proximity to the Peru\\u2013Chile Trench, the city is vulnerable to earthquakes. The Peru\\u2013Chile Trench stores large amounts of energy for a very long time and sometimes ruptures after short intervals in a violent earthquake.\\n\\n## Climate =Valpara\\u00edso has a very mild Mediterranean climate (K\\u00f6ppen Csb). The summer is essentially dry, but the city is affected by fogs from the Humboldt Current during most of the year. In the winter, rainfall can occasionally be extremely heavy when a powerful frontal system crosses central Chile, but frequency of such rains varies greatly from year to year. Monthly average temperatures vary just around 6\\u00b0C between the coolest and the warmest month, from 17 \\u00b0C (63 \\u00b0F) in January to 11.4 \\u00b0C (52.5 \\u00b0F) in July. Snowfall occurs rarely in the highest parts of the city. In winter, strong winds can lead to wind chill temperatures below freezing.\\n\\n\\n## Cityscape \\nNicknamed \\&quot;The Jewel of the Pacific\\&quot;, Valpara\\u00edso was declared a world heritage site based upon its improvised urban design and unique architecture. In 1996, the World Monuments Fund declared Valpara\\u00edso&#x27;s unusual system of funicular lifts (steeply inclined carriages) one of the world&#x27;s 100 most endangered historical treasures. In 1998, grassroots activists convinced the Chilean government and local authorities to apply for UNESCO world heritage status for Valpara\\u00edso. Valpara\\u00edso was declared a World Heritage Site in 2003. Built upon dozens of steep hillsides overlooking the Pacific Ocean, Valpara\\u00edso has a labyrinth of streets and cobblestone alleyways, embodying a rich architectural and cultural legacy. Valpara\\u00edso is protected as a UNESCO World Heritage Site.\\nSince its status as a World Heritage Site, Valpara\\u00edso has made several changes to its urban fabric in the process of maintaining its cultural heritage.\\nLandmarks include:\\n\\nIglesia de la Matriz\\nPlaza An\\u00edbal Pinto\\nPlaza Sotomayor including the Edificio Armada de Chile\\nEdificio Luis Cousi\\u00f1o\\nCourthouse\\n16 remaining funiculars (called ascensores): 15 public (national monuments) and 1 private (which belongs to \\&quot;Hospital Carlos Van Buren\\&quot;).\\nThe Concepcion and Alegre historical district\\nThe Bellavista hill, which has the \\&quot;Museo a Cielo Abierto\\&quot; or \\&quot;open air museum\\&quot;\\nMonument to Admiral Lord Thomas Alexander Cochrane, 10th Earl of Dundonald\\nMonument to Manuel Blanco Encalada, first Chilean President\\nCapilla del Carmen\\nCemeteries on Pante\\u00f3n Hill \\u2013 Cemetery Number One (Catholic) and Dissidents Cemetery (Protestant)\\n=&quot;, &quot;images&quot;: [&quot;https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/7/79/Arco_Brit%C3%A1nico.jpg&quot;, &quot;https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/4/4e/Ascensor_Artilleria_Valpara%C3%ADso.JPG&quot;, &quot;https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/3/32/Ascensor_Artiller%C3%ADa.jpg&quot;, &quot;https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/9/90/Ascensor_Conception-_Built_in_1883.jpg&quot;], &quot;near&quot;: [], &quot;lat&quot;: -71.6127458, &quot;lon&quot;: -33.0473128, &quot;maps&quot;: &quot;https://www.google.com/maps/search/?api=1&amp;query=Valpara%C3%ADso%20Chile%20Valpara%C3%ADso%2C%20Chile&quot;, &quot;citymapper&quot;: &quot;https://citymapper.com/directions?endcoord=-33.0473128,-71.6127458&amp;endname=Valpara%C3%ADso%20Chile&quot;, &quot;icon&quot;: &quot;https://img.icons8.com/?size=150&amp;id=ZS7ZmeyTmK3P&quot;}\n",

During the Chilean War of Independence, it was a favourite hiding place for the independence leader Manuel Rodriguez, and later the well-known Chileans Diego Barros Arana, Jos\\u00e9 Manuel Balmaceda and others would occupy these lands for the same purpose.\\nFinally, the lands fell into the possession of the Cranisbro family, who were great benefactors of the Dominican order that had a monastery on one side of San Vicente Ferrer Church. The church is characterized by the copper domes that top its two towers, built in memory of the death of two Cranisbro children. The church was declared a National Monument in 1983 and the surrounding area was listed as a traditional heritage site.\\nThe modern market in Pueblito Los Dominicos was born in the late 70s and early 80s to house the workshops and stores of craft workers and artists. Over the years, and after having been named a traditional heritage zone by the Chilean government, the place became popular among Chilean and international tourists.\\nThe park that holds the modern market was once part of a \\u201cfundo\\u201d, which gives the market its rural, rustic look. In the 80s, artists and artisans took over the farm\\u2019s old cellars and stables and built more small shops using traditional, colonial-style adobe.\\n\\n\\n## Stores In the near 200 stores can be found all kinds of traditional goods, including leather work, wood craft, sculptures, paintings, copper cookware, fine jewellery, pets, flowers, medicinal herbs, Chilean plants (as well as some foreign plants such as bonsais), and also some traditional foods such as typical Chilean empanadas and Pastel de choclo.\\n=&quot;, &quot;images&quot;: [&quot;https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/5/56/Los_Dominicos_en_Santiago_de_Chile.jpg&quot;, &quot;https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/7/73/Volantines_en_los_Dominicos.jpg&quot;], &quot;near&quot;: [], &quot;lat&quot;: -70.5416066, &quot;lon&quot;: -33.4107367, &quot;maps&quot;: &quot;https://www.google.com/maps/search/?api=1&amp;query=Pueblito%20Los%20Dominicos%20los%20Dominicos%20Garden%20-%20Pilay%208702%2C%20Las%20Condes%2C%20Regi%C3%B3n%20Metropolitana%2C%20Chile&quot;, &quot;citymapper&quot;: &quot;https://citymapper.com/directions?endcoord=-33.4107367,-70.5416066&amp;endname=Pueblito%20Los%20Dominicos&quot;, &quot;icon&quot;: &quot;https://img.icons8.com/?size=150&amp;id=Ah17OpXv85zO&quot;}\n",

It is located where formerly the Mapocho River used to fork. The oval-shaped plaza is the focal point of celebrations and riots in the city.

En la segunda mitad del siglo XIX y principios del siglo XX el barrio adquirir\\u00eda notoriedad como uno de los barrios m\\u00e1s selectos del Puerto, raz\\u00f3n por la que inmigrantes brit\\u00e1nicos, alemanes y yugoslavos edificar\\u00edan aqu\\u00ed sus palacios y casas. Con el declive econ\\u00f3mico de Valpara\\u00edso a mediados del siglo XX, estas colonias europeas comenzaron a emigrar y los chilenos ocupar\\u00edan su lugar como pobladores del cerro.

Lo que s\\u00ed es cierto es que la cueva era temida de mucho antes de la llegada de los espa\\u00f1oles a la zona.

El castillo estaba guarnecido por cincuenta soldados y artilleros; se encontraba ubicado en una zona alejada de la poblaci\\u00f3n de Valpara\\u00edso de aquella \\u00e9poca, dada su naturaleza defensiva.

Por lo tanto, en 1674, bajo el mandato del virrey Baltasar de la Cueva y Enr\\u00edquez de Cabrera, se autoriz\\u00f3 al gobernador para utilizar el producto del impuesto del almojarifazgo durante dos a\\u00f1os para la construcci\\u00f3n del castillo. \\u00c9ste fue colocado en una posici\\u00f3n elevada que dominaba la bah\\u00eda desde el sur y recibi\\u00f3 el nombre de castillo de la Concepci\\u00f3n.[4]\\u200b\\nEl historiador Benjam\\u00edn Vicu\\u00f1a Mackenna defin\\u00eda al Valpara\\u00edso colonial como \\u00abuna aldea de frailes y ca\\u00f1ones\\u00bb. Esto aplicaba, en efecto, al cerro Concepci\\u00f3n. Apenas poblado por el castillo y un pu\\u00f1ado de monjes, de hecho, hasta 1724 el cerro fue propiedad de la Orden de San Agust\\u00edn, a\\u00f1o en que el cerro fue vendido al capit\\u00e1n Luis Garc\\u00eda Venegas. \\nNo ser\\u00eda hasta bien entrado el siglo XIX y, ya con la Independencia superada, que el cerro Concepci\\u00f3n se urbanizar\\u00eda ni poblar\\u00eda adecuadamente. Por aquel entonces se segu\\u00eda percibiendo al cerro como un n\\u00facleo urbano aparte, alejado del Valpara\\u00edso urbano, m\\u00e1s cercano al Almendral. Prueba de esto hallamos en la construcci\\u00f3n del polvor\\u00edn de cerro C\\u00e1rcel y los primeros cementerios en cerro Pante\\u00f3n erigidos en 1825, ambos proyectos concebidos para las \\u201cafueras de Valpara\\u00edso\\u201d.\\nLa primera edificaci\\u00f3n civil de la que se tiene constancia en la zona data de 1822. Y perteneci\\u00f3 a William Bateman, un comerciante ingl\\u00e9s que fue asesinado por su propia servidumbre en su mansi\\u00f3n a\\u00f1os m\\u00e1s tarde.\\nFue en 1833 cuando otro comerciante brit\\u00e1nico, Josu\\u00e9 Waddington, adquiri\\u00f3 la zona del cabo y procedi\\u00f3 a dinamitar la parte baja, eliminando el pe\\u00f1asco, exponiendo la ya renombrada cueva del Chivato y dando inicio a las obras que permitir\\u00edan el ensanchamiento de las calles del plan y la expansi\\u00f3n de Valpara\\u00edso hacia el mar. Es en esta \\u00e9poca que se considera que cerro Alegre y Concepci\\u00f3n pasaron a ser parte integral de la ciudad.\\nEl cerro Concepci\\u00f3n es una zona que no puede ser separada de su vecino, el cerro Alegre, debido \\u2014entre otras cosas\\u2014 a que a partir de 1822, ambas regiones recibieron a miembros de colonias extranjeras, siendo la colonia brit\\u00e1nica la primera en asentarse en el cerro Alegre, mientras que en el Concepci\\u00f3n fue hogar de una importante comunidad alemana. Estos inmigrantes, atra\\u00eddos por el aire fresco, la vista al mar y la tranquilidad de estar alejados del bullicio central, dise\\u00f1aron un urbanismo diverso que inclu\\u00eda pasajes y miradores, mansiones elegantes y jardines florecidos. Para 1840, estos barrios ofrec\\u00edan un entorno europeo con un estilo arquitect\\u00f3nico predominantemente ingl\\u00e9s. La catedral anglicana de Saint Paul fue construida por los brit\\u00e1nicos en 1857, mientras que los alemanes erigieron la iglesia luterana de la Santa Cruz en 1897. \\nEn 1856, el alumbrado p\\u00fablico fue introducido en Valpara\\u00edso y el cerro Concepci\\u00f3n recibi\\u00f3 quince farolas de gas, los cuales reemplazaron a los antiguos faroles a sebo o parafina. \\nSeg\\u00fan el censo de 1880, la poblaci\\u00f3n de Valpara\\u00edso alcanzaba los 100.515 habitantes y, seg\\u00fan la carta topogr\\u00e1fica de 1884 dirigida por Recaredo Santos Tornero, la subdelegaci\\u00f3n n.\\u00ba 8, el cerro Concepci\\u00f3n, contaba con 4.971 habitantes.\\nEn 1883 fue inaugurado el Ascensor Concepci\\u00f3n, el m\\u00e1s antiguo de los ascensores de la ciudad. \\u00c9ste conecta el pasaje El\\u00edas, frente al Reloj Turri con el paseo Gervasoni del cerro. Fue declarado Monumento Hist\\u00f3rico en 1998. Durante sus primeros a\\u00f1os funcionaba con un sistema de contrapesos de agua y calderas a vapor, eventualmente se cambi\\u00f3 a un sistema el\\u00e9ctrico.\\n\\n\\n## Lugares t\\u00edpicos La catedral anglicana Saint Paul es uno de los monumentos m\\u00e1s preciados del cerro. Construida por el ingeniero ingl\\u00e9s William Lloyd en 1858, fue el primer templo de esta confesi\\u00f3n que profesaba la mayor\\u00eda de los miembros de la colonia brit\\u00e1nica residente. La construcci\\u00f3n fue pol\\u00e9mica debido a la mayor\\u00eda cat\\u00f3lica de Valpara\\u00edso, raz\\u00f3n por la que no les fue permitido erigir una torre ni tener puerta principal mirando hacia el altar.[5]\\u200b En 1897 los alemanes levantaron la iglesia Luterana de Valpara\\u00edso, ubicada a un par de cuadras de la anglicana. \\nOtro de los atractivos es el ascensor Concepci\\u00f3n, inaugurado el 1 de diciembre de 1883, cuyos carros de madera eran accionados por contrapeso, seg\\u00fan un sistema hidr\\u00e1ulico que operaba mediante estanques de agua, ubicados en ambos lados del recorrido. El ascensor contin\\u00faa siendo un medio c\\u00f3modo y agradable de subir al Concepci\\u00f3n.[6]\\u200b \\nTambi\\u00e9n destacan dentro del cerro los miradores con espectaculares vistas a la bah\\u00eda, como los de los paseos Pierre Loty, Atkinson y Gervasoni. El Yugoslavo pr\\u00e1cticamente une los cerros Concepci\\u00f3n y Alegre, por lo que para subir se puede elegir tambi\\u00e9n el ascensor El Peral, que lleva desde la plaza de Justicia hasta el citado paseo, donde en el Palacio Baburizza tiene su sede el Museo Municipal de Bellas Artes.[7]\\u200b \\nEn el paseo Gervasoni tiene su sede la Casa Mirador Lukas, que es tanto un museo del famoso caricaturista como una sala de exposiciones.[8]\\u200b\\n\\n\\n## Referencias \\n\\n## Enlaces externos  Wikimedia Commons alberga una categor\\u00eda multimedia sobre Cerro Concepci\\u00f3n.\\nCiudadanos del Cerro Concepci\\u00f3n.\\nIglesia Saint Paul&#x27;s.\\nIglesia Luterana de Valpara\\u00edso.&quot;, &quot;images&quot;: [&quot;https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/1/10/Cerro_Concepci%C3%B3n%2C_Valpara%C3%ADso_20201102_127.jpg&quot;], &quot;near&quot;: [], &quot;lat&quot;: -71.62638, &quot;lon&quot;: -33.04253, &quot;maps&quot;: &quot;https://www.google.com/maps/search/?api=1&amp;query=Cerro%20Concepci%C3%B3n%20Cerro%20Concepci%C3%B3n%20-%20Abtao%20675%2C%202370822%20Valpara%C3%ADso%2C%20Chile&quot;, &quot;citymapper&quot;: &quot;https://citymapper.com/directions?endcoord=-33.04253,-71.62638&amp;endname=Cerro%20Concepci%C3%B3n&quot;, &quot;icon&quot;: &quot;https://img.icons8.com/?size=150&amp;id=j05edJz5Xwy0&quot;}\n",

Valpara\\u00edso was named originally for Valpara\\u00edso de Arriba, in Castile-La Mancha, Spain. It is located about 120 km (75 mi) northwest of Santiago, by road, and is one of the Pacific Ocean&#x27;s most important seaports. Valpara\\u00edso is the capital of Chile&#x27;s second most-populated administrative region and has been the  Chilean Navy headquarters since 1817, as well as being the seat of the Chilean National Congress (since 1990). \\nValpara\\u00edso played an important geopolitical role in the second half of the 19th century when it served as a major stopover for ships traveling between the Atlantic and Pacific oceans via  the Straits of Magellan. The area experienced rapid growth during its golden age as a magnet for European immigrants, when the city was known by international sailors as \\&quot;Little San Francisco\\&quot; and \\&quot;jewel of the Pacific\\&quot;. Notable acquisitions from this golden age include Latin America&#x27;s oldest stock exchange, the continent&#x27;s first volunteer fire department, Chile&#x27;s first public library, and the oldest Spanish language newspaper in continuous publication in the world, El Mercurio de Valpara\\u00edso. In 2003, the historic quarter of Valpara\\u00edso was declared a UNESCO World Heritage Site.\\nThe twentieth century was unfavorable to Valpara\\u00edso, as many wealthy families abandoned the city. The opening of the Panama Canal in 1914, and the associated reduction in ship traffic, dealt a serious blow to the region&#x27;s shipping- and port-based economy. By the 21st century, the port of San Antonio had surpassed Valpara\\u00edso in trade volume (TEU) handled, leading to the questioning of its traditional moniker of Puerto Principal (\\&quot;principal port\\&quot;) of Chile. \\nBetween the years of 2000 to 2015, the city experienced a recovery, attracting artists, tourists, and cultural entrepreneurs, who settled after they were attracted by the city&#x27;s hillside historic districts. Today, many thousands of people visit Valpara\\u00edso each month, from Chile and abroad, to enjoy the city&#x27;s labyrinth of cobbled alleys and colorful buildings. The Port of Valpara\\u00edso still continues to be a major distribution center for container traffic, copper, and fruit exports. It also receives growing attention from cruise ships that visit during the South American summer. Most significantly, Valpara\\u00edso has transformed itself into a major educational and entertainment hub, with four large traditional universities, and several large vocational colleges. \\nWhile the city is well-known for its artisans and bohemian culture, it is also famous as the home of several highly-regarded music festivals and other artistic events. The largest, and arguably most iconic, is the annual Vi\\u00f1a Del Mar International Song Festival (often simply called \\&quot;Vi\\u00f1a\\&quot; or \\&quot;Vi\\u00f1a Del Mar\\&quot;). Typically held in March, in a recently-refurbished, 40,000-capacity amphitheater, \\&quot;Vi\\u00f1a\\&quot; is one of the biggest annual economic boosts to the region, as the event usually sells-out completely, and thousands of attendees and workers will travel to and stay in the city and metro area. In addition to showcasing numerous performers of many styles, and awarding various prizes, the internationally-televised and live-streamed festival is typically headlined by superstar musicians, from both the Spanish- and English-speaking worlds.\\n\\n\\n## History \\nSome older works starting with Benjam\\u00edn Vicu\\u00f1a Mackenna (1869) claim that Valpara\\u00edso was within the range of the Chango people, but clear evidence for this is lacking.\\nThe Bay of Valpara\\u00edso&#x27;s first ethnically identifiable population were Picunche natives, known for their agriculture. Spanish explorers, considered the first European discoverers of Chile, arrived in 1536, aboard the Santiaguillo, a supply ship sent by Diego de Almagro. The Santiaguillo carried men and supplies for Almagro&#x27;s expedition, under the command of Juan de Saavedra, who named the town after his native village of Valpara\\u00edso de Arriba in Cuenca Province, Spain.\\n\\nDuring Spanish colonial times, Valpara\\u00edso remained a small village, with only a few houses and a church. On some occasions she was attacked by English pirates and privateers, such as Francis Drake with his ship Golden Hind in 1578 and later his cousin Richard Hawkins with his ship Dainty in 1594. Drake&#x27;s sack of Valpara\\u00edso gave origin to the legend about Cueva del Pirata.\\n\\nIn 1810, a wealthy merchant built the first pier in the history of Chile and the first during the colonial era. In its place today, stands the building of El Mercurio de Valpara\\u00edso. The ocean then rose to this point. Reclamation of land from the sea moved the coastline five blocks away. Between 1810 and 1830, he built much of the existing port of the city, including much of the land reclamation work that now comprises the city&#x27;s commercial centre. \\nIn 1814, the naval Battle of Valpara\\u00edso was fought offshore of the town, between American and British ships involved in the War of 1812. After Chile&#x27;s independence from Spain (1818), beginning the Republican Era, Valpara\\u00edso became the main harbour for the nascent Chilean navy, and opened international trade opportunities that had been formerly limited to Spain and its other colonies.\\n\\nValpara\\u00edso soon became a desired stopover for ships rounding South America via the Straits of Magellan and Cape Horn. It gained particular importance supporting and supplying the California Gold Rush (1848\\u20131858). As a major seaport, Valpara\\u00edso received immigrants from many European countries, mainly from Britain, Germany, France, Switzerland and Italy. German, French, Italian and English were commonly spoken among its citizens, who founded and published newspapers in these languages.\\nValpara\\u00edso found maritime competition with Callao (Per\\u00fa). Both cities sought to be the dominant port on the Pacific Coast of South America during the period of time known as the High Trade (1880\\u20131930). \\nThe British community, La Colonia Britanica, prospered in Valpara\\u00edso between the 1820s and 1920s. Firms such as Antony Gibbs &amp; Sons, Duncan Fox, and Williamson-Balfour Company were doing business in the town, which had become a significant trading center by 1840, with 166 British ships, out of a total of 287, anchored in its port. The British settled on Cerro Alegre (Mount Pleasant) and Cerro Concepci\\u00f3n. The Association of Voluntary Firemen was created in 1851, a telegraph service to Santiago was operating by 1852, and Chile&#x27;s first telephone service was set up in 1880. The British Hospital was founded in 1897, and the British Arch, Arco Brit\\u00e1nico, was erected in 1911. However, by 1895, Italian immigrants exceeded the British, and both the Italians and Germans were in larger numbers by 1907. By 1920, both the Italians and Spanish outnumbered the British, and the primary British community within Chile resided in Santiago. \\n\\nInternational immigration transformed the local culture from Spanish origins and Amerindian origins, in ways that included the construction of the first non-Catholic cemetery of Chile, the Dissidents&#x27; Cemetery. Football (soccer) was introduced to Chile by English immigrants; and the first private Catholic school in Chile, Le Coll\\u00e8ge des Sacr\\u00e9s C\\u0153urs (\\&quot;Sacred Hearts College\\&quot;) and its accompanying Sacred Hearts Church, by French immigrants. Immigrants from Scotland and Germany founded the first private secular schools (The Mackay School and Die Deutsche Schule, respectively). Immigrants formed the first volunteer fire-fighting units (still a volunteer activity in Chile). Their buildings reflected a variety of European styles, making Valpara\\u00edso more varied than some other Chilean cities.\\nOn 18 August 1906, a major earthquake struck Valpara\\u00edso; there was extensive property damage and thousands of deaths. The Chilean doctor, Carlos Van Buren, of U.S. descent, was involved in the medical care of earthquake victims. He later established the Hospital  Carlos Van Buren in 1912.\\nThe golden age of Valpara\\u00edso&#x27;s commerce ended after the opening of the Panama Canal in 1914. Shipping shifted to the canal as captains sought to avoid the risks of the Strait of Magellan. The port&#x27;s use and traffic declined significantly, causing a decline in the city&#x27;s economy. The opening of the Panama Canal was one of the most critical events in the shaping of Valpara\\u00edo&#x27;s economy. Since the turn of the 21st century, shipping has increased in the last few decades with fruit exports, opening the Chilean economy to world commerce, and larger-scale, Post-Panamax ships that do not fit the Panama Canal.\\n\\n## 19th century On 28 March 1814, the USS Essex was defeated by British frigates Phoebe and Cherub during the War of 1812, leading to the deaths of 58 US Marines. Captain David Porter, a survivor of this attack, would retire to Portersville, Indiana, and request changing the name to Valparaiso, commemorating the only naval battle he ever lost. By 2 August 1820, the Liberating Expedition of Peru sailed from Valpara\\u00edso.\\nAt 10:30 pm on the evening of 19 November 1822, Valpara\\u00edso experienced a violent earthquake that left the city in ruins; of the 16,000 residents, casualties included at least 66 adults and 12 children, as well as 110 people wounded. The next day, a meteor trail was visible from Quillota to Valpara\\u00edso, seen as a religious experience for much of the population.\\nIn 1826, the Royal Navy Great Britain established a South America Station in Valpara\\u00edso to maintain British naval interest in the region. It would remain until 1837, when it was relocated to Esquimalt, British Columbia. 12 September 1827 saw the establishment of El Mercurio de Valpara\\u00edso, the oldest circulating newspaper in the Spanish language worldwide.\\nIn May 1828, a constitutional convention began regular meetings in the church of San Francisco. By August 9, the Constitution of the Republic of Chile was fully drafted and disseminated.\\nOn 6 June 1837, Minister Diego Portales was shot at the port outside of Baron Hill on suspicion of promoting conspirators who opposed the Peru-Bolivian Confederation, considered a turning point of Chilean public opinion and the purpose of the war.\\nBy 1851, the first fire brigade in the country was formed. The next year potable running water became available, as well as the first telegraph service in Latin America, between the city and Santiago. It would be another four years before streetlights, with 700 gas lanterns, were installed. In 1861 the first tram company was formed, mostly using horses or mules to draw them, and fully established over the next few years.\\nIn 1852, British shipping company Williamson, Balfour &amp; C\\u00eda was established in Valpara\\u00edso to handle trade in the region. \\nTaking advantage of the total lack of defenses, a Spanish fleet commanded by Casto M\\u00e9ndez N\\u00fa\\u00f1ez bombarded the city during the Chincha Islands War in 1866. Chilean merchant ships were sunk, except for those vessels whose captains hoisted foreign flags.\\nA merger of the National Steamship Company and Chilean Steamship Company, the South American Steamship Company was created as a national response to the increasing dominance of the Pacific Steam Navigation Company in 1872. In 1880 the Chilean Telephone Company was formed by Americans Joseph Husbands, Peter MacKellar, James Martin, and the US consul Lucius Foot, the first official telephone company in the country. Three years later on the first of December, Concepci\\u00f3n funicular opened, the first of many hydraulic systems. After the country&#x27;s independence and its consequent openness to international trade, Valpara\\u00edso became an important port of call on trade routes through the Eastern Pacific. Many immigrants settled there, mostly from Europe and North America, who helped include Valpara\\u00edso and Chile in the Industrial Revolution sweeping other parts of the world. This created a different city with civil, financial, commercial and industrial institutions, many of which still exist today.\\nAll this resulted in a population increases. The city reached more than 160,000 inhabitants in the late nineteenth century, making it necessary to use the steep hills for more houses, mansions and even cemeteries. The lack of available land caused the city authorities and developers to reclaim low lying tidal marshland (polders) upon which to build administrative, commercial and industrial infrastructure.\\n\\n## 20th century The twentieth century began with the first big protest of dockworkers, Chile on 15 April 1903, due to complaints by dockers about their excessive working hours and demands for higher wages, requests that were ignored by employers, creating a tense situation that led to serious violence on 12 May. There were protests and the burning of the CSAV offices and several people were shot and killed. All this prompted intervention by the state. This protest was important for the future of Trade Unionism in the country.\\nThat same year, electric trams were introduced.\\nThe 1906 Valpara\\u00edso earthquake caused severe damage throughout the city on 16 August, which was at that time the heart of the Chilean economy. The damage was valued at hundreds of millions of pesos of the time, and human victims were counted at 3,000 dead and over 20,000 injured. After the removal of the debris, reconstruction work began. This included the widening of streets, culverting and covering streams, (Jaime and Delicias \\u2013 creating the avenues Francia and Argentina respectively). The main street of the city (Pedro Montt) was laid and Plaza O&#x27;Higgins was created; a hill was removed to allow the passage of Colon Street. The damaged Edwards mansion was demolished and in its place, the present Cathedral of Valpara\\u00edso was built and, among many other works, this gave shape to the Almendral Valpara\\u00edso area.\\nIn 1910, the port expansion work of the city, which ended in 1930, began. A long breakwater was built, along with piers and docking terminals.\\nThe Imperial German East Asia Squadron engaged the British West Indies Squadron on 1 November 1914 at the Battle of Coronel off the coast of Valparaiso, sinking two British cruisers. After the battle the East Asia Squadron stayed in Valparaiso Harbor before continuing to the Falklands.\\n\\n## 21st century Chile&#x27;s legislature along with other institutions of national importance like the National Customs Service, the National Fish and Aquaculture Ministry, the Ministry of Culture and the Barracks General of the Chilean Navy are sited in the city. In addition to the capital of the Valpara\\u00edso Region hosts the Regional Administration and government.\\nIn 2003, Valpara\\u00edso became an UNESCO World Heritage Centre. This title was awarded to Valparaiso for its unique urban form, as well as its clear maintained historical background as a colorful port city. In becoming a World Heritage Center, Valpara\\u00edso is tasked with maintaining its cultural heritage, through the maintenance of its historic infrastructure, like its Ascensores.\\nOn 13 April 2014, a huge brush fire burned out of control, destroying 2,800 homes and killing 16 people, forcing President Michelle Bachelet to declare it a disaster zone.\\nIn early February 2024, a huge brush fire burned through Valparaiso and central Chile, killing at least 131 people.\\n\\n\\n## Geography \\nValpara\\u00edso is located in central Chile, 120 km (75 mi) to the north west of the capital Santiago. Valpara\\u00edso, like most of Chile, is vulnerable to earthquakes. Before the earthquake of February 27, 2010, which measured 8.8 on the moment magnitude scale, the last catastrophic earthquake to strike Valpara\\u00edso devastated the city in August 1906, killing nearly 3,000 people. Other significant earthquakes to affect the city were the 1730 Valpara\\u00edso earthquake and the 1985 Algarrobo earthquake.\\n\\n## Geology =Because of Valpara\\u00edso&#x27;s proximity to the Peru\\u2013Chile Trench, the city is vulnerable to earthquakes. The Peru\\u2013Chile Trench stores large amounts of energy for a very long time and sometimes ruptures after short intervals in a violent earthquake.\\n\\n## Climate =Valpara\\u00edso has a very mild Mediterranean climate (K\\u00f6ppen Csb). The summer is essentially dry, but the city is affected by fogs from the Humboldt Current during most of the year. In the winter, rainfall can occasionally be extremely heavy when a powerful frontal system crosses central Chile, but frequency of such rains varies greatly from year to year. Monthly average temperatures vary just around 6\\u00b0C between the coolest and the warmest month, from 17 \\u00b0C (63 \\u00b0F) in January to 11.4 \\u00b0C (52.5 \\u00b0F) in July. Snowfall occurs rarely in the highest parts of the city. In winter, strong winds can lead to wind chill temperatures below freezing.\\n\\n\\n## Cityscape \\nNicknamed \\&quot;The Jewel of the Pacific\\&quot;, Valpara\\u00edso was declared a world heritage site based upon its improvised urban design and unique architecture. In 1996, the World Monuments Fund declared Valpara\\u00edso&#x27;s unusual system of funicular lifts (steeply inclined carriages) one of the world&#x27;s 100 most endangered historical treasures. In 1998, grassroots activists convinced the Chilean government and local authorities to apply for UNESCO world heritage status for Valpara\\u00edso.

Su nombre se debe a los bellos jardines que adornaban las casas del sector, que en el siglo XIX estaba habitado principalmente por inmigrantes ingleses. \\nFormula una unidad geogr\\u00e1fica y cultural con el vecino Cerro Concepci\\u00f3n. Cerro Alegre es barrio de un conjunto de sitios atractivos, como restaurantes, miradores, hoteles de lujo, hostales y otros alojamientos m\\u00e1s tradicionales. \\n\\n\\n## Geograf\\u00eda El barrio de Cerro Alegre est\\u00e1 comprendido por las calles Almirante Montt y Jos\\u00e9 Tom\\u00e1s Ramos en sus extremos laterales, Calle Prat en su extremo inferior y calle Carlos Pezoa Veliz en su extremo superior. Limita con los barrios Puerto y Cerro Cordillera hacia el norte, Financiero y el centro de Valpara\\u00edso hacia el este, Cerro C\\u00e1rcel hacia el sur y Playa Ancha Alto hacia el oeste.\\nTiene una superficie de unos 0,7 km\\u00b2 y una poblaci\\u00f3n de 6 124 habitantes seg\\u00fan el censo del 2017. Su densidad de poblaci\\u00f3n es de 15 310 habitantes/km\\u00b2.\\n\\n\\n## Historia Distinguidos capitanes de la conquista fueron los primeros habitantes del cerro Alegre, cuyos terrenos correspond\\u00edan a una de las mercedes otorgadas por Pedro de Valdivia a oficiales que encabezaban las tropas en las diferentes campa\\u00f1as. Los capitanes Juan Rodrigo de Guzm\\u00e1n y Nicol\\u00e1s Octavio fueron los primeros espa\\u00f1oles en instalarse en el cerro. En 1672, ambos donaron sus terrenos a la orden de los agustinos; medio siglo despu\\u00e9s, en 1724, el prior Miguel Arru\\u00e9 los vendi\\u00f3 nuevamente a un militar, al capit\\u00e1n Luis Garc\\u00eda Venegas.[1]\\u200b\\nEn 1822,el comerciante William Bateman construy\\u00f3 la primera casa y un camino para subir. Le sigui\\u00f3 John Martin, tambi\\u00e9n brit\\u00e1nico. Tras el terremoto de 1822, se comenz\\u00f3 a construir casonas de estilo arquitect\\u00f3nico ingl\\u00e9s y una iglesia protestante. El barrio fue poblado por la naciente burgues\\u00eda comerciante local, en su mayor\\u00eda brit\\u00e1nicos y alemanes.\\nEn la segunda mitad del siglo XIX, viv\\u00edan en Cerro Alegre Samuel Oxley, Jorge Rose Innes, los comerciantes Templeman y David Allerdice, el constructor de barcos Juan Atkinson y el presbiteriano David Trumbull.\\nTras la independencia, los porte\\u00f1os criollos lo llamaban cerro Alegre, y los ingleses residentes Mount Pleasent. Se le conoci\\u00f3 tambi\\u00e9n como cerro de los Jud\\u00edos. Para llegar al cerro desde el puerto, se deb\\u00eda subir por la Quebrada de San Agust\\u00edn (actual Calle Jos\\u00e9 Tom\\u00e1s Ramos), y luego subir por el Camino de los Aguadores, actual calle Estanque.\\nEn 1857 se fund\\u00f3 el Colegio Ingl\\u00e9s Mc Kay en calle del Hospital (actual Guillermo Munnich), el colegio ingl\\u00e9s m\\u00e1s antiguo de Chile y posteriormente, el Saint Margaret&#x27;s British School for Girls. En 1877, se crea el Colegio de Nuestra Se\\u00f1ora de la Misericordia y el Hospital Alem\\u00e1n, en el espacio que ocup\\u00f3 la Quinta Buchnann, obra de la colonia alemana de la ciudad y segundo hospital alem\\u00e1n de Sudam\\u00e9rica. En 1901, los residentes del barrio descendientes de ingleses, fundaron la d\\u00e9cima primera Compa\\u00f1\\u00cda de Bomberos \\&quot;George Garland\\&quot;. Su cuartel estuvo en Montealgre, detr\\u00e1s de la parroquia.\\nEn 1909 se funda el club deportivo Everton en la casa de David Foxley. Este equipo de f\\u00fatbol se traslad\\u00f3 a Vi\\u00f1a del Mar debido a que la Asociaci\\u00f3n Central de F\\u00fatbol solo aceptaba un equipo oficial por ciudad. En 1991, por iniciativa del Rotary Club de Valpara\\u00edso, se crea el Centro de Capacitaci\\u00f3n Laboral \\&quot;Agust\\u00edn Turner\\&quot;.\\n\\n\\n## Sitios de inter\\u00e9s \\n## Cerro Concepci\\u00f3n =El cerro Concepci\\u00f3n es en conjunto uno de los lugares m\\u00e1s atractivos y tur\\u00edsticos de Valpara\\u00edso con restaurantes y miradores como el Paseo Mirador Atkinson y el Paseo Gervasoni. En este \\u00faltimo se encuentra el ascensor Concepci\\u00f3n, el primero de la ciudad. El sector toma su nombre por el Castillo Concepci\\u00f3n, construido en 1676 en donde actualmente se encuentra el paseo Atkinson. Este cerro sirvi\\u00f3 de uni\\u00f3n del puerto de Valpara\\u00edso con el barrio El Almendral cuando a\\u00fan no se ganaba terreno al mar. Fue uno de los primeros sectores altos de la ciudad en ser poblado.\\n\\n## Montealegre =En este sector se ubican casonas de car\\u00e1cter se\\u00f1orial. Vivi\\u00f3 aqu\\u00ed el cirujano naval escoc\\u00e9s Tom\\u00e1s Leighton, cuya calle de residencia fue renombrada en su honor. En calle Leighton vivi\\u00f3 la familia Fontaine, Federico Rudolph, Alberto Karlezi y el senador Pedro Ib\\u00e1\\u00f1ez Ojeda. Sobre calle Montealegre estaba la casa de la familia Karlsrusher, donde vivir\\u00eda posteriormente el alcalde Sergio Vuskovic. Otros vecinos ilustres del sector Montealegre fueron Arturo Vorwerk Klee, Sara Vial de los Heros, Thomas Somerscales, Medardo Espinoza, Rafael Luis Barahona, Luc\\u00eda D&#x27;Ambra, la familia Vianello y H\\u00e9ctor Radrig\\u00e1n.\\n\\n## Paseo Yugoslavo =El paseo Yugoslavo es el lugar m\\u00e1s representativo de cerro Alegre. Est\\u00e1 ubicado a 45 metros sobre el nivel del mar en la salida de la estaci\\u00f3n superior del ascensor El Peral. Se encuentran aqu\\u00ed el Palacio Astoreca y el Museo de Bellas Artes de Valpara\\u00edso en las dependencias del Palacio Baburizza. \\nAnteriormente era conocido como Paseo Americano. La casas construidas en este sector remontan de afines del siglo XIX y principios del siglo XX, las cuales fueron financiadas con las fortunas obtenidas del salitre. Entre las ricas familias salitreras que se asentaron en el Paseo Yugoslavo se encuentran los Baburizza, los Zanelli, los Astoreca y los Antoncich.\\nEn 1916 se construy\\u00f3 el palacio de la familia Zanelli, el cual fue comprado en 1925 por Pascual Baburizza. En 1928, se remodel\\u00f3 el paseo a manos del arquitecto Vicente Callovich. \\n\\n\\n## Cultura \\n## Deportes =El deporte m\\u00e1s popular en Cerro Alegre fue el baloncesto. En 1912, naci\\u00f3 la organizaci\\u00f3n New Crusaders, que tuvo su mayor \\u00e9xito en 1950 tras derrotar a Uni\\u00f3n Espa\\u00f1ola, campe\\u00f3n durante 25 a\\u00f1os seguidos del campeonato local y representantes de Chile en los Juegos Ol\\u00edmpicos de Berl\\u00edn. Sus jugadores m\\u00e1s destacados eran Hern\\u00e1n Raffo y Ortega. En su \\u00e9poca del oro, el club tuvo ramas de atletismo, f\\u00fatbol, nataci\\u00f3n y waterpolo. La cancha de basquetbol fue construida en 1958 y est\\u00e1 al final del pasaje Santa Victorina.\\nEn lo que respecta al f\\u00fatbol, el club deportivo Everton de Vi\\u00f1a del Mar fue creado en Cerro Alegre. En atletismo, una de las figuras m\\u00e1s destacadas fue Francisco Allen, quien rompi\\u00f3 el r\\u00e9cord sudamericano de 3000 metros con obst\\u00e1culos el 21 de mayo de 1989.\\n\\n## Educaci\\u00f3n =Establecimientos de educaci\\u00f3n b\\u00e1sica:\\n\\nEscuela B\\u00e1sica Montessori\\nEscuela Particular San Luis\\nColegio Bordemar\\nEstablecimientos de educaci\\u00f3n media:\\n\\nLiceo N\\u00b021 Pedro Montt\\nColegio Mar Abierto\\nColegio Montessori\\nColegio Nuestra Se\\u00f1ora de la Misericordia\\nColegio Puerto Paz\\nColegio Internacional Valpara\\u00edso\\nEstablecimientos de educaci\\u00f3n superior:\\n\\nInstituto de M\\u00fasica de la Pontificia Universidad Cat\\u00f3lica de Valpara\\u00edso\\nCentro de Capacitaci\\u00f3n Laboral \\&quot;Agust\\u00edn Turner\\&quot;\\n\\n## Iglesias y parroquias =Parroquia de San Luis Gonzaga.\\nIglesia Luterana de la Santa Cruz.\\nCapilla San Luis.\\nCatedral Anglicana de San Pablo.\\nIglesia de Jesucristo de los Santos de los \\u00daltimos D\\u00edas, estaca Cerro Alegre.\\n\\n## Artes =Ubicada a la salida de la estaci\\u00f3n superior del ascensor Reina Victoria, la plazoleta Lukas, despu\\u00e9s de remodelada en 2014, se ha convertido en un especie de museo al aire libre en homenaje al famoso dibujante Renzo Pecchenino. Con apoyo de la Municipalidad de Valpara\\u00edso y la Fundaci\\u00f3n Lukas, los artistas Cynthia Aguilera (que tambi\\u00e9n firma sola como Cines) y Sammy Espinoza (Jekse o Jehkse), d\\u00fao que firma sus grafitis como Unkolordistinto, han recreado los personajes del Bestiario del Reyno de Chile en los muros y tiendas de la peque\\u00f1a plaza.[2]\\u200b\\nDesde ella se abren hermosas vistas del vecino cerro Concepci\\u00f3n y, particularmente, de su iglesia luterana de La Santa Cruz. Aqu\\u00ed comienza el paseo Dimalow, con su hotel boutique Casa Vander, que da a la plazoleta y cuya cara norte, que mira al ascensor, est\\u00e1 adornada en su parte inferior con el largo mural La gallada, personajes de Lukas pintados por Unkolordistinto.[2]\\u200b \\nEl paseo Dimalow es famoso tanto por las vistas que se aprecian desde \\u00e9l como por los murales que se pueden admirar al recorrerlo, entre los que destaca el inmenso personaje pintado por La Robot de Madera (se ve desde el comienzo del paseo, a la derecha, en la cara norte de un edificio), que tiene en su pecho una torre en llamas. Dimalow termina en la calle Almirante Montt, la que, a la derecha, conduce a la iglesia anglicana de San Pablo, que marca el comienzo del cerro Concepci\\u00f3n.\\nLa estaci\\u00f3n superior del ascensor El Peral \\u2014cerrado por un a\\u00f1o a partir del 1 de junio de 2015 para una \\&quot;recuperaci\\u00f3n integral\\&quot;\\u2014[3]\\u200b da a la calle del mismo nombre; a pocos pasos, a la izquierda, comienza el paseo Yugoslavo, con el magn\\u00edfico Palacio Baburizza, sede del Museo Municipal de Bellas Artes, que tiene una valiosa colecci\\u00f3n de obras de artistas nacionales y extranjeros. Desde el paseo, que fue uno de los primeros miradores del puerto, se abre una bella panor\\u00e1mica de la bah\\u00eda de Valpara\\u00edso. En este paseo, en la esquina oriente del Baburizza, est\\u00e1 la calle Montealegre, que conecta con el cerro Concepci\\u00f3n. \\nEn la calle Galos esquina Templeman, se encuentra la iglesia de san Luis de Gonzaga (conocida simplemente tambi\\u00e9n como iglesia San Luis y oficialmente como Parroquia San Luis de Gonzaga), fundada en 1890 por los padres palotinos irlandeses ante la necesidad de contar con un lugar de culto cat\\u00f3lico en un sector poblado por inmigrantes que ya ten\\u00edan el citado templo anglicano y el luterano de la Santa Cruz, ambos en el vecino cerro Concepci\\u00f3n. Juana Ross de Edwards don\\u00f3 los terrenos para su construcci\\u00f3n en 1890, que estuvo a cargo del arquitecto Nicanor Marambio[4]\\u200b y que dur\\u00f3 dos a\\u00f1os y medio: fue inaugurada el 8 de marzo de 1893.[5]\\u200b Despu\\u00e9s, desde 1934 y 1965, fue de los palotinos alemanes; fueron ellos, concretamente el p\\u00e1rraco Clemente Klepper en 1935, quien la hizo part\\u00edcipe del Movimiento apost\\u00f3lico de Sch\\u00f6nstatt. Detr\\u00e1s de la iglesia est\\u00e1 la plazuela San Luis, punto importante de conjunci\\u00f3n de 6 calles: Almirante Montt, Capilla, Montealegre, Alemania, M\\u00fanich y Estanque.

It is named after Rafael Sotomayor. The square is lined by buildings occupying full block-fronts of the streets that flank it. The focus of the square is the monument that honors the Chilean sailors who fell during the Battle of Iquique and the Battle of Punta Gruesa. The plaza and surrounding buildings was designated a Zona T\\u00edpica (historic district) on January 23, 1979.\\n\\nAt the northeastern side of the square are two similar towers, which create a sort of gate entrance to the port from the city. On the opposite side is the building that housed the Intendencia de Valpara\\u00edso, which currently is home to the headquarters of the Chilean Navy. The building used by the CSAV and the building that houses the National Council of Culture and the Arts also face the plaza.\\nClose to the station is the western terminus station of the Valpara\\u00edso Metro, that replaced the old railway station.\\n\\n\\n## History Sotomayor Square originally called Plaza de la Aduana (Customs Square), then Plaza del Palacio (Palace Square) and later Plaza Intendencia (Intendancy Square), is the most important civic square in Valpara\\u00edso, which was built over previous sealand. The history of the city lays in it, consisting of buildings from different periods that merge into one big area. It didn&#x27;t always have a trapezoid shape as it does today, which helps to create a different perspective effect, neither had the decisive axis between the main building \\u2014 the former intendancy building \\u2014 nor its view of the ocean. Originally, it was an esplanade in which filthy water descended sluggishly through San Agust\\u00edn (Tom\\u00e1s Ramos) gorge, standing next to the current Plaza de la Justicia (Justice Square). Also, a large house near to Cerro Cordillera (Cordillera Hill) played the role of customs.\\nOn 10 June 1825 a storm broke the cables of the frigate Valdivia and stranded her on the beach that existed here. The authorities filled the hulk with sand in order to use it as a base for Valparaiso&#x27;s first wharf for passengers and light cargo. Subsequently, in 1831, the passengers\\u2019 wharf started to be built, whose remains can be seen today at the museum right under the square.\\nAfter the construction of the first customs building, the most representative building of the city for almost seventy years, a square started to be built next to it. Although it was smaller and the building line was several meters ahead of the current facades, in the mid-century the latter was extended to Condell Street. In addition, some warehouses were built around it and also hotels and inns.\\nIn 1855 came into existence in this square the first bank in Chile called the Banco de Dep\\u00f3sitos y Descuentos de Valpara\\u00edso (The Deposits and Discounts Bank of Valpara\\u00edso), occupying part of the current square in front of the land of the present National Council of Culture and the Arts. The Bolsa de Comercio building was constructed with wood and cane from Guayaquil in 1858 and designed by the architect Juan Berg, who created a porch to access the city from the sea. The Bolsa de Comercio was inaugurated in the same year, 6 May with a special ceremony led by the President of Chile, Manuel Montt. Additionally, in the year 1866, the city of Valpara\\u00edso was bombed by the Spanish Navy during the Chincha Islands War originating from a trade dispute between Spain and Peru. Although Spain tried to burn down the Bolsa de Comercio, the building survived the attack and it was repaired afterwards. The construction of the first Post Office, next to the Bank in the corner of the Aduana (Prat) Street, and the fire department building, between Blanco and Cochrane Streets, both dating from 1868, contributed decisively to the characterization of the square as a civic one. These were neoclassical buildings that would be later replaced in the first half of the 20th century by modern architecture but preserving its early use.\\nIn 1873, the square was already cobbled when the first sculpture of Valpara\\u00edso was built in 12 April, commemorating the Scottish seamen Lord Thomas Cochrane. In 1876, the railway crossed around the shore in front of the wharf and went from the current Err\\u00e1zuriz Street towards the Barrio Puerto (Port&#x27;s Neighbourhood). In the same year, the construction of the Rose Company building took place, which was called Innes, and then Grace, whose facades remained until today as part of the Compa\\u00f1\\u00eda Sudamericana de Vapores\\u2019 building. In 1885, the Bolsa de Comercio (The Stock Exchange) located in Valpara\\u00edso square right in front of the Hotel Reina Victoria (Queen Victoria Hotel) had to be demolished to install in its place the great monument to the fallen heroes in the Battle of Iquique and the crypt of the remains of Arturo Prat and his men, which would be inaugurated on 21 May 1886. The following year, a neoclassical building was built on the grounds of the current port station that was meant to serve as the administration of the Navy and other public uses, and would remain so until 1920. In 1883, a comfortable passengers\\u2019 wharf was ordered to be built. Made of wood and metal with hexagonal shape, this passengers\\u2019 wharf also known as Muelle Prat (Prat wharf), would last until 1912 when it was swept away by a storm. Until the early 20th century there was still a building in front of the Queen Victoria Hotel occupying part of the Estaci\\u00f3n Puerto (Port Station) and the customs building, which were built in the 30s.\\nIn 2000, the Ministry of Housing and Urban Development (es) inaugurated the work of remodeling the square, directed by the architect Harken Jensen, where a concession was granted for subterranean parking lots, and additionally, a museum was inaugurated due to archeological findings in the same place. In 2004, the design of the square extends to the Prat Wharf, turning it into a touristic walkway from which was possible to embark in order to cross the roadstead of Valpara\\u00edso from the sea. At the Prat wharf is possible to see a replica of the Santiaguillo (es), a small sailing boat which was the first Spaniard vessel to dock in this bay called Quintil.\\nThe first wharf completed in 1883 corresponds to the passengers\\u2019 wharf, made of wood and metal with hexagonal shape.\\n&quot;, &quot;images&quot;: [&quot;https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/3/3c/Monumento_H%C3%A9roes_Iquique.jpg&quot;], &quot;near&quot;: [], &quot;lat&quot;: -71.6282501, &quot;lon&quot;: -33.0384959, &quot;maps&quot;: &quot;https://www.google.com/maps/search/?api=1&amp;query=Plaza%20Sotomayor%20Sotomayor%2C%20Valpara%C3%ADso%2C%20Chile&quot;, &quot;citymapper&quot;: &quot;https://citymapper.com/directions?endcoord=-33.0384959,-71.6282501&amp;endname=Plaza%20Sotomayor&quot;, &quot;icon&quot;: &quot;https://img.icons8.com/?size=150&amp;id=H4ubSTbctL4w&quot;}\n",

Los estudios comenzaron en 1897, encargados por el Ministerio de Industria y Obras P\\u00fablicas, que design\\u00f3 una \\u00abJunta del Camino Plano\\u00bb, dirigida por Enrique Budge, y que ten\\u00eda como misi\\u00f3n construir una calzada carretera, a un costado de la l\\u00ednea f\\u00e9rrea contigua al mar, con el ancho suficiente para instalar una v\\u00eda de tranv\\u00edas.[3]\\u200b\\nA pesar de la oposici\\u00f3n de la Empresa de los Ferrocarriles del Estado al nuevo uso de parte de sus terrenos,[1]\\u200b en 1899 comenzaron las obras para la construcci\\u00f3n del camino a un costado de la v\\u00eda ferroviaria, con el desmonte de los cerros que llegaban a la l\\u00ednea y el aplanamiento de un ancho de 10 metros.[2]\\u200b El 28 de enero de 1906 se inaugur\\u00f3 la v\\u00eda con el nombre de Camino Plano en una ceremonia realizada en la estaci\\u00f3n Vi\\u00f1a del Mar por el intendente Joaqu\\u00edn Fern\\u00e1ndez Blanco.[1]\\u200b[4]\\u200b El sector m\\u00e1s cercano a Valpara\\u00edso, entre la estaci\\u00f3n Bar\\u00f3n y la Caleta Portales, fue el \\u00fanico que fue cubierto con adoquines de piedra y piedra de r\\u00edo.[3]\\u200b\\nEl incremento del tr\\u00e1fico y los primeros autom\\u00f3viles, sumado a la escasa mantenci\\u00f3n, llevaron al deterioro de la obra. La pavimentaci\\u00f3n total del camino comenz\\u00f3 en 1916 y sus obras fueron inauguradas el 1 de octubre de 1922, cuando fue finalmente denominada avenida Espa\\u00f1a.[4]\\u200b[5]\\u200b\\n\\n\\n## Caracter\\u00edsticas Es una de las avenidas con mayor caudal de tr\\u00e1nsito de la regi\\u00f3n y las m\\u00e1s transitadas del pa\\u00eds; se inicia en el Nudo Bar\\u00f3n, Valpara\\u00edso, y finaliza en el eje Viana - \\u00c1lvares en Vi\\u00f1a del Mar. Se encuentra en el borde costero, con vista constante al oc\\u00e9ano Pac\\u00edfico.\\nEn su recorrido se ubican tres estaciones de metro: Bar\\u00f3n, Portales y Recreo. Dentro de su extensi\\u00f3n es posible apreciar la Universidad T\\u00e9cnica Federico Santa Mar\\u00eda, el instituto profesional Inacap y la caleta Portales. \\nEsta v\\u00eda est\\u00e1 a las faldas de los cerros Bar\\u00f3n (en ella se encuentra la estaci\\u00f3n baja del ascensor del mismo nombre), Placeres, Esperanza y Recreo.

Al costado norte de la v\\u00eda se extienden las playas Caleta Abarca en Vi\\u00f1a del Mar y Los Placeres/Portales en Valpara\\u00edso.\\nEl 15 de enero de 2018 se dio inicio a las obras de re asfaltado de toda la Avenida, desde Nudo Bar\\u00f3n en Valpara\\u00edso hasta Puente Capuchinos en  Vi\\u00f1a del Mar.

Su nombre es en honor a su segundo propietario, el empresario croata Pascual Baburizza, que adquiri\\u00f3 la mansi\\u00f3n en 1925.[1]\\u200b La casona se convirti\\u00f3 en sede del Museo Municipal de Bellas Artes de Valpara\\u00edso en 1971 y ocho a\\u00f1os m\\u00e1s tarde fue declarada Monumento Hist\\u00f3rico.\\n\\n\\n## Historia La construcci\\u00f3n de la casona la encarg\\u00f3 don Ottorino Zanelli (\\u00bf? \\u2013 1916), un emigrante italiano originario de la provincia de Savona, quien lleg\\u00f3 a Chile en la segunda mitad del siglo XIX, acompa\\u00f1ado de sus hermanos Julio, Nicol\\u00e1s y Enrique y un primo. Se instalaron primero en la provincia de Tarapac\\u00e1 y se dedicaron al comercio de alimentos y otros productos para abastecer a las pulper\\u00edas de la zona. En 1882, los cuatro hermanos formaron una sociedad; compraron la oficina salitrera Aguas Blancas, en Antofagasta. Zanelli fue cofundador de la Compa\\u00f1\\u00eda de Bomberos Pompiere Ausonia de Iquique y se cas\\u00f3 en segundas nupcias con la porte\\u00f1a Margarita Morales, con la que tuvo siete hijos: Amalia, Armando, Ra\\u00fal Luis, Renato, Carlos y Florencio.[2]\\u200b \\nEn 1914, Ottorino Zanelli compr\\u00f3 el sitio en el cerro Alegre, donde los arquitectos Barison y Schiavon construyeron su residencia. Sin embargo, Zanelli no alcanz\\u00f3 a disfrutar de la mansi\\u00f3n, pues muri\\u00f3 el mismo a\\u00f1o en que acabaron de levantarla. La viuda vendi\\u00f3 en 1925 la casa a don Pascual Baburizza, croata que, como los Zanelli, hab\\u00eda llegado al norte de Chile y hab\\u00eda hecho fortuna en la zona del salitre.[3]\\u200b\\nBarison y Schiavon se inspiraron en la est\\u00e9tica modernista, m\\u00e1s espec\\u00edficamente en la corriente del Art Nouveau austriaco, el Jugenstil.[4]\\u200b  Ambos arquitectos hab\\u00edan estudiado primero en la Escuela Industrial de Trieste y luego en Viena. Llegaron a Valpara\\u00edso poco despu\\u00e9s del devastador terremoto de 1906, en un periodo de auge urban\\u00edstico y de reconstrucci\\u00f3n de la ciudad.\\nLa arquitectura de la casona \\&quot;corresponde a las t\\u00edpicas construcciones del centro de Europa y que se encuentran en el norte de Francia, sur de Alemania y en los alrededores de Praga\\&quot;. Son similares a ella la mansi\\u00f3n de Joseph Maria Olbrich en Darmstadt, la casa Tassel del belga Victor Horta en Bruselas, o la villa Majorelle del arquitecto franc\\u00e9s Henri Sauvage, en  Nancy.[2]\\u200b \\n\\nCuando compr\\u00f3 el palacio, Baburizza le realiz\\u00f3 algunas modificaciones importantes. As\\u00ed, donde hab\\u00eda una terraza, agreg\\u00f3 un sal\\u00f3n, e instal\\u00f3 all\\u00ed una gran chimenea de m\\u00e1rmol. Para decorarla, encarg\\u00f3 un gobelino franc\\u00e9s con tema de cacer\\u00eda. Tambi\\u00e9n agreg\\u00f3 un piso, la mansarda, para lo cual elev\\u00f3 el antiguo techo, y coron\\u00f3 la parte m\\u00e1s alta de la casona con un torre\\u00f3n. \\nBaburizza escogi\\u00f3 al arquitecto Vicente Colovic para realizar las modificaciones estructurales y de los espacios interiores de la casa. Calovic fue asimismo el encargado de construir en 1929 el paseo delante de la mansi\\u00f3n; el cual fue donado por el empresario a la ciudad. La Municipalidad le cambi\\u00f3 el nombre, de paseo Americano, a Paseo Yugoslavo, en honor a la procedencia de su benefactor.[5]\\u200b\\nEl palacio tiene cerca de dos mil metros construidos repartidos en una planta baja o z\\u00f3calo, dos pisos con salones y salas de estilo con sobrios artesonados; una mansarda, una amplia escala al segundo piso, ascensor interior y otros espacios, m\\u00e1s los jardines y terrazas. El museo lo conforman actualmente la mansi\\u00f3n de Baburizza y la de atr\\u00e1s, donde viv\\u00eda su sobrino. Ambas construcciones est\\u00e1n unidas por un patio interior en el primer nivel, y por un puente vidriado en el segundo. Esta segunda casa habitaci\\u00f3n ten\\u00eda acceso por la calle Montealegre, el cual hoy no se utiliza. Adem\\u00e1s cuenta con un sal\\u00f3n y una espl\\u00e9ndida chimenea, en estilo art d\\u00e9co. Exteriormente, la fachada de ambas edificaciones es continua y no se aprecian diferencias entre ambas. \\n\\nDe la imponente puerta principal de madera destacan los adornos de metal y las dos columnas que la escoltan. El edificio adjunto tiene relieves, capiteles, ventanas de madera, decoraciones de hierro y diversas figuras. Los decorados en forma de espirales tanto en muros como en rejas, recuerdan el estilo del pintor Gustav Klimt; y los decorados, a la villa del pintor b\\u00e1varo Franz von Stuck. Los bajo relieves contienen formas y figuras enigm\\u00e1ticas como los tri\\u00e1ngulos dentro de tri\\u00e1ngulos en las canaletas de agua.[6]\\u200b\\nLos artesonados de los techos de los salones principales son valiosos, as\\u00ed como la marqueter\\u00eda de los z\\u00f3calos y el dise\\u00f1o de las chimeneas. Una de ellas es de m\\u00e1rmol veteado y est\\u00e1 enmarcada por un gran gobelino franc\\u00e9s; hay otra sencilla en el sal\\u00f3n contiguo y dos de revestimientos en madera y cer\\u00e1micos, que originalmente se alimentaban con gas. Una de estas se encuentra en el hall de los salones interiores, de estilo art d\\u00e9co.\\n\\nSon destacables las dos puertas de rejas, una en la pasada del primer piso, y otra antes del que era el dormitorio de Baburizza. En el segundo piso se ubica un mirador saliente de esquina que permite una vista hacia el paseo, la plaza y la calle Montealegre, algo com\\u00fan en la arquitectura alemana y austriaca.\\nEn el exterior destacan los grandes faroles en fierro forjado y toda la cerrajer\\u00eda, herrer\\u00eda y enrejados que fueron realizados en los talleres de Alejandro Santambrogio; as\\u00ed como los yesos, m\\u00e1rmoles y relieves escult\\u00f3ricos de Carmelo Faggioni. Los z\\u00f3calos, la puerta principal y otros ornamentos son ricos en maderas nobles, provenientes de la F\\u00e1brica de Muebles Art\\u00edsticos de F\\u00e9lix Mazzoni. Todo se armoniza con los juegos de aleros, salientes y vanos, terminados en una techumbre de cobre envejecido. \\nLos salones patrimoniales del primer piso conservan su aspecto original \\u2014con elementos museogr\\u00e1ficos indispensables, como iluminaci\\u00f3n, c\\u00e1maras de vigilancia, alarmas, sistemas contra incendios, filtros en ventanas y persianas\\u2014, pero las dem\\u00e1s dependencias han sido adaptadas para su funci\\u00f3n de museo. Se ha rehabilitado el antiguo ascensor interior de la casa y agregado uno nuevo desde el acceso a la extensi\\u00f3n. \\n\\n \\nLa municipalidad compr\\u00f3 en 1971 el palacio a los herederos del empresario croata y lo convirti\\u00f3 en sede del citado museo. Veinticinco a\\u00f1os despu\\u00e9s, este cerr\\u00f3 debido a su deterioro. El edificio pas\\u00f3 diversas etapas de restauraci\\u00f3n. \\nEn agosto de 2008, el Programa de Recuperaci\\u00f3n y Desarrollo Urbano de Valpara\\u00edso (PRDUV), que depende de la Subsecretar\\u00eda de Desarrollo Regional y Administrativo, termin\\u00f3 la primera fase de recuperaci\\u00f3n, que contempl\\u00f3 la estabilizaci\\u00f3n del torre\\u00f3n. En una segunda etapa, realizada entre diciembre del 2009 y febrero del 2010, se repararon los da\\u00f1os causados por la humedad, tratamiento fitosanitario y obras de seguridad del sistema el\\u00e9ctrico y de la red de agua.[7]\\u200b \\nLa \\u00faltima fase de restauraci\\u00f3n se realiz\\u00f3 de acuerdo un proyecto coordinado por el arquitecto Mario P\\u00e9rez de Arce. Finalmente, el palacio fue reinaugurado por el presidente Sebasti\\u00e1n Pi\\u00f1era, el 27 de septiembre de 2012.\\nEl inmueble fue declarado Monumento Hist\\u00f3rico por el decreto 1876, de 19 de julio de 1979.\\nDon Pascual Baburizza fue coleccionista de arte, y leg\\u00f3 sus cuadros a Valpara\\u00edso; ellos pasaron a integrar los fondos del Museo Municipal de Bellas Artes y hoy constituyen la Colecci\\u00f3n Europea, que se exhibe en el primer piso.\\n\\n\\n## Galer\\u00eda \\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n## V\\u00e9ase tambi\\u00e9n Museo Municipal de Bellas Artes de Valpara\\u00edso\\nPascual Baburizza\\nPalacios de Valpara\\u00edso\\nPalacio Valle\\n\\n\\n## Referencias ==&quot;, &quot;images&quot;: [&quot;https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/6/69/1_sala.JPG&quot;, &quot;https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/b/b0/Ascensor_El_Peral_01.jpg&quot;, &quot;https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/f/f2/Gobelino_fr_con_esc_caceria_sobre_chimenea_-MMBAV_Salon_1p.jpg&quot;, &quot;https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/8/8e/Palacio_Baburizza%2C_Valparaiso_01.jpg&quot;], &quot;near&quot;: [], &quot;lat&quot;: -71.6288609, &quot;lon&quot;: -33.040252, &quot;maps&quot;: &quot;https://www.google.com/maps/search/?api=1&amp;query=Palacio%20Baburizza%20P.%C2%BA%20Yugoslavo%20176%2C%20Valpara%C3%ADso%2C%20Chile&quot;, &quot;citymapper&quot;: &quot;https://citymapper.com/directions?endcoord=-33.040252,-71.6288609&amp;endname=Palacio%20Baburizza&quot;, &quot;icon&quot;: &quot;https://img.icons8.com/?size=150&amp;id=lAwJ42xa0VsG&quot;}\n",

Designed in 1907 by the French Architect Louis Dubois, a graduate of the \\u00c9cole des Beaux-Arts in Paris, the 70-room hotel is one of the most prominent surviving local examples of the French Art Nouveau style.\\n\\n\\n## History It was designed by architect Louis Dubois in 1904 and opened in 1906 originally called Lutetia Hotel, and was one of the greatest representatives of Art Nouveau arrived in Argentina in the early twentieth century. The Avenida de Mayo was still a fashionable avenue, opened in 1896, where during the passage of the first decade of the styles used for buildings evolved, from academicism or Neoclassicism to Art Nouveau, Art Deco and later.\\nMoreover Avenue, which had been designed for residences of the aristocracy and great palaces, was exploited by the owners of the land to build apartment buildings there income (rent) which quickly mutated into hotels. At that historical moment was constructed Hotel Lutetia.\\nHe later became National Hotel. In 1938, it changed hands and became Chile Hotel Romanelli, still owned by the hotelier Romanelli. Sunday May Avenue fell into decay over the decades and the shift of focus of the company to other sectors driven by its transformation into the artery leading political and social situations in the country. When connecting the Palace of Congress with the House of Government, political demonstrations and marches focused mainly on it.\\nThe worst Hotel Chile disaster occurred on August 4, 1988, when a fire broke out at 0:30 am on the 4th floor, 2 extending to the attic (5th floor) and the dome, and totally consuming them within two hours. Also the front of the building was seriously damaged, large pieces of masonry falling into the street. The hotel was restored, replacing the slate mansard corrugated iron, without recovering his famous dome, and received through a facade. The neighboring building on Avenida de Mayo, designed by architect Dubois, was also affected by the incident, and had to be completely reworked then also lost its cupola bay window and run adorning its facade.\\nOn the ground floor of the Hotel Chile, accessed through the facet, worked for years the Spanish restaurant Spain Square, one of several that specialize in traditional cuisine in this section of the Avenida de Mayo, artery historically adopted by the Spanish to their meetings and trade since the early twentieth century.\\n&quot;, &quot;images&quot;: [&quot;https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/0/08/Avenida_de_Mayo_Hotel_Chile.jpg&quot;, &quot;https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/c/cb/Hotel_Chile_%281%C2%BA_piso%29.JPG&quot;, &quot;https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/6/61/Hotel_Chile_%282%C2%BA_piso%29.JPG&quot;, &quot;https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/c/ce/Nuvola_filesystems_folder_home_Argentina.png&quot;], &quot;near&quot;: [], &quot;lat&quot;: -70.6441679, &quot;lon&quot;: -33.4357389, &quot;maps&quot;: &quot;https://www.google.com/maps/search/?api=1&amp;query=Luminoso%20y%20con%20AC%3A%20vista%20al%20Museo%20Bellas%20Artes%20Ismael%20Vald%C3%A9s%20Vergara%20492%2C%20492%2C%208320075%20Santiago%2C%20Regi%C3%B3n%20Metropolitana%2C%20Chile&quot;, &quot;citymapper&quot;: &quot;https://citymapper.com/directions?endcoord=-33.4357389,-70.6441679&amp;endname=Luminoso%20y%20con%20AC%3A%20vista%20al%20Museo%20Bellas%20Artes&quot;, &quot;icon&quot;: &quot;https://img.icons8.com/?size=150&amp;id=oSXnsjjZF3Uk&quot;}\n",

It is popularly known locally as either Cumbica Airport, after the district where it is located and the Brazilian Air Force base that exists at the airport complex, or Guarulhos Airport, after the municipality of Guarulhos, in the state of S\\u00e3o Paulo, where it is located. Since November 28, 2001, the airport has been named after Andr\\u00e9 Franco Montoro (1916\\u20131999), former Governor of S\\u00e3o Paulo state. The airport was rebranded as GRU Airport in 2012.\\nThe airport was the busiest in Brazil in terms of transported passengers, aircraft operations, and cargo handled in 2012, placing it as the second busiest airport in Latin America by passenger traffic (41.307.915 2023) after Mexico City International Airport. Guarulhos has slot restrictions, operating with a maximum of 45 operations/hour and being one of the five airports with such restrictions in Brazil (the others are S\\u00e3o Paulo-Congonhas, Bras\\u00edlia, Belo Horizonte-Pampulha and Rio de Janeiro-Santos Dumont).\\nSince 2012, the airport has been operated by a consortium composed of Invepar S/A, Airports Company South Africa, and Infraero.\\nSome of its facilities are shared with the S\\u00e3o Paulo Air Force Base of the Brazilian Air Force.\\n\\n\\n## History \\nOn June 6, 1967, in response to the growth of air traffic in Brazil, the Brazilian military government initiated studies concerning the renovation of the airport infrastructure in Brazil. As part of the conclusions of these studies, because of their location, strategic importance, and security issues, new passenger facilities would be constructed in the areas of Gale\\u00e3o Air Force Base in Rio de Janeiro and S\\u00e3o Paulo Air Force Base in S\\u00e3o Paulo.\\nIn relation to S\\u00e3o Paulo, the initial planning of the airport involved three runways and four passenger terminals. However, the first phase of the construction comprising two runways and two terminals started only on August 11, 1980. The airport was officially inaugurated on January 20, 1985. Quickly Guarulhos became the city&#x27;s primary airport, supplanting S\\u00e3o Paulo\\u2013Congonhas Airport.\\nIn 1989 the runways were extended and the terminals renovated, enlarged, and had their capacity increased from 7.5 million to 8.25 million passengers/year. The whole complex covered 13.86 square kilometres (3,425 acres), of which 5 square kilometres (1,200 acres) is urbanised area.\\nConstruction of Terminal 3, capable of handling 12 million passengers per year, had been planned since 2001 but due to a myriad of political and economic problems, the actual construction didn&#x27;t begin until 2011.\\nIn 2010, the airport served more than 26.8 million passengers, an increase of 24% over 2009 and passenger volumes were 31% in excess of its capacity rated at 20.5 million per year at its present configuration.\\nIn order to relieve the acute overcrowding at Terminals 1 and 2, Infraero announced on May 17, 2011 that the former cargo terminals of defunct airlines VASP and Transbrasil, later used by Federal Agencies, would undergo renovations and adaptations for use as domestic passenger terminals with remote boarding. This new terminal was initially called Terminal 4 (T4). The first phase of the renovations, comprising the former VASP terminal, opened on February 8, 2012, and the second phase, comprising the former Transbrasil terminal, was opened in June 2013. Contrary to what had been announced before, the new terminal will be permanent. Webjet was the first airline to use the new facility. The new terminal, in its first phase, increased the capacity of the airport in 5.5 million passengers/year and, in the second phase to 8 million passengers/year. In total, Guarulhos would then be able to handle 28.5 million passengers/year.\\nResponding to critiques to the situation of its airports, on May 18, 2011, Infraero released a list evaluating some of its most important airports according to its saturation levels. According to the list, Guarulhos was considered to be critically saturated, operating above 85% of its capacity.\\nFollowing a decision made on April 26, 2011 by the Federal Government for private companies being granted concessions to explore some Infraero airports, on February 6, 2012, the administration of the airport was conceded, for 20 years, to the Consortium Invepar\\u2013ACSA, also known as GRU Airport, composed by the Brazilian Invepar, an Investments and Funds Society (90%) and the South African ACSA\\u2013Airports Company South Africa (10%). Infraero, the state-run organisation, remains with 49% of the shares of the company incorporated for the administration.\\nOn December 2, 2015, the airport&#x27;s terminals were renumbered. Former Terminal 4 was renumbered Terminal 1; former terminals 1 and 2, which were wings of a single building, became the new Terminal 2. Terminal 3 kept its numbering. The new numbering reflects the order by which terminals are reached when one arrives at the airport by the access road, and is expected to be less confusing in the long term. Check-in counters and gates were also renumbered, with the first digit being now the new terminal number.\\nOn October 28, 2015, the National Civil Aviation Agency of Brazil (Anac) authorised Airbus A380 operations at Guarulhos Airport, effective four days later. The authorisation was granted after extensive works were conducted on the runways and taxiways (including widening runway 09L/27R to 60 metres (196 ft 10 in)) and special taxiing procedures were established. On November 14, 2015, Emirates operated a one-time special flight with the A380 on its Dubai-S\\u00e3o Paulo route to commemorate its eight years of operations in Brazil.\\nOn March 26, 2017, Emirates started daily A380 service from Dubai to S\\u00e3o Paulo, replacing the Boeing 777-300ER previously used on that route \\u2013 coincidentally, on the same day that the other UAE airline, Etihad, ended its services to S\\u00e3o Paulo.\\n\\n\\n## Facilities \\n## Runways and taxiways =GRU has two parallel runways. Runway 10R/28L is 3,000 metres (9,843 ft) long and 45 metres (148 ft) wide, while runway 10L/28R is 3,700 metres (12,140 ft) long and 60 metres (200 ft) wide, after being widened in 2015 to better receive the Airbus A380. The field elevation at the airport is 750 metres (2,459 ft) above mean sea level. Runway 10R/28L is mostly used for landings and runway 10L/28R for takeoffs. There are high-speed exit taxiways on both runways that allow for traffic to depart the runway at higher speed to allow better efficiency for landing and takeoff traffic. As of 2014, there was an average of 650 takeoff and landing operations per day at the airport.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n## Terminals =The airport has three passenger terminals, numbered 1, 2, and 3, according to their order along the airport access road when arriving from the city.\\n\\nTerminal 1 is the smallest and simplest. It has only domestic flights, and as of January 2020, only Azul operates there, as former Passaredo (now VoePass) has been moved to Terminal 2. Terminal 1 has no jet bridges and no direct access to the other terminals, which can only be reached by a free shuttle bus.\\nTerminal 2 is the oldest and largest, and for many years was the sole airport terminal, although its two wings were considered different terminals at the time. It has the majority of domestic flights and to Latin American destinations, as well as a few intercontinental flights.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nTerminal 3 is the newest and most modern. It has only international flights and concentrates most long-haul intercontinental traffic, in addition to the LATAM Group&#x27;s Latin American flights. Five of the terminal&#x27;s gates can accommodate the Airbus A380.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nTerminals 2 and 3 are directly linked by a walkway.\\nThe airport also has a large air cargo terminal with a built area of 97,000 square metres (1,040,000 sq ft) and is capable of handling any type of cargo, including refrigerated and hazardous shipments.\\n\\n## Navigational aids =There are two navigational aids that GRU traffic uses. The Bonsucesso very high frequency omnidirectional range with distance measuring equipment (VOR-DME) is located 9.1 kilometres; 5.6 miles (4.9 nmi) to the east of GRU.\\n\\n\\n## Developments In 2009 Infraero unveiled a R$ 1,489.5 million (US$784.7 USD million; \\u20ac549.8 EUR million) investment plan to upgrade Guarulhos International Airport, focusing on preparations for the 2014 FIFA World Cup and the Summer Olympics in 2016. The investment was supposed to be used as follows:\\n\\nConstruction of additional taxiways. Cost: R$ 19M. Completion: April 2016.\\nEnlargement of apron and taxiways. Cost: R$370,5M. Completion: May 2016.\\nConstruction of passenger Terminal 3. Cost: R$1,100M. Completed: March 2014. Opened for Star Alliance airlines in May.\\nCentral to this investment plan was Terminal 3, which is projected to add 12 million passenger capacity to the 17 million of the existing two terminals. Plans for a third runway were decided to be \\&quot;technically impracticable\\&quot; and were cancelled in January 2008.\\nHowever, the former concessionary, Infraero, experienced many legal and bureaucratic difficulties, which prevented most (if any) of these improvements from being completed on schedule. As of April 2013, the new concessionary unveiled a new expansion project, which included the new Terminal 3 (with a different design than the one proposed by Infraero), the widening of the main runway in order to enable operations by the large Airbus A380 and Boeing 747-8, operated by Emirates and Lufthansa respectively, and several other improvements in the existing terminals and parking area.\\nTerminal 3 is open and all Star Alliance airlines are in, as well as many other overseas carriers. International flights by LATAM also use the facility.\\nA train service development and construction has also been planned, however never concluded and cancelled. This included an Airport Express Line linking the airport to downtown S\\u00e3o Paulo and a Rio\\u2013S\\u00e3o Paulo high-speed rail connecting Guarulhos to Rio de Janeiro-Gale\\u00e3o and Campinas-Viracopos airports.\\nSince March 2017 American Airlines invested US$ 100 million on a 17,000 m2 (180,000 sq ft) maintenance hangar at Guarulhos Airport, building together with the LATAM Hangar of R$ 130 million. The American Airlines one is capable of performing line maintenance on two wide-body aircraft at the same time, of the types commonly used by the U.S. company on routes between S\\u00e3o Paulo and the United States and the LATAM one is capable of performing line maintenance of one wide-body aircraft. It could also be used by other companies as storage for parts. The same conditions applies to the LATAM maintenance center.\\n\\n\\n## Airlines and destinations \\n## Passenger Note:\\na: Flights operated with Voepass equipment on behalf of LATAM Brasil.\\nb: Flights temporarily being operated to Canoas Air Force Base.\\n\\n## Cargo \\n## Statistics \\nFollowing is the number of passenger, aircraft and cargo movements at the airport, according to Infraero (2007-2012) and GRU Airport (2013-2023) reports:\\n\\n\\n## Accidents and incidents On January 28, 1986, a VASP Boeing 737-2A1 registered PP-SME flying from Guarulhos to Belo Horizonte unknowingly tried to take-off from Guarulhos, during foggy conditions, from a taxiway. The take-off was aborted, but the aircraft overran, collided with a dyke and broke in two. One passenger died.\\nOn March 21, 1989, a Transbrasil cargo Boeing 707-349C registered PT-TCS operating flight 801, flying from Manaus to S\\u00e3o Paulo-Guarulhos, crashed at the district of Vila Barros in Guarulhos, shortly before touch-down at runway 09R. That day, at 12:00, the runway was going to be closed for maintenance and the crew decided to speed up procedures to touch-down before closure (it was already 11:54). In a hurry, one of the crew members, by mistake, activated the air-dynamic brakes, and the aircraft lost too much speed to have enough aerodynamic support (resulting in a stall). As a consequence the aircraft crashed approximately 2 kilometres (1.2 mi) from the airport. There were 25 fatalities, of which three were crew members and 22 were civilians on the ground. As well as the 22 fatalities, there were over 200 injured on the ground.\\nOn March 2, 1996, a Madrid T\\u00e1xi A\\u00e9reo Gates Learjet 25D registered PT-LSD transporting the Brazilian band Mamonas Assassinas crashed into Cantareira mountain range, located north of the airport, at 23:16 local time killing all 9 passengers on board. The aircraft was on final approach to land on the runway 09R, but went around. As it flew toward the runway for a second attempt to land, the ATC instructed the pilots to make a right turn heading south, but they turned north (left) and crashed into the mountain range at 3,300 feet (1,000 m), 10.0 kilometres (6.2 mi) from the airport. Ironically, all band members were from a Guarulhos neighborhood located close to the airport.\\nOn September 14, 2002, a Total Linhas A\\u00e9reas ATR42-312 registered PT-MTS on a cargo flight between S\\u00e3o Paulo-Guarulhos and Londrina crashed while en route near Paranapanema. The crew of 2 died.\\n\\n\\n## Access The airport is located 25 km (16 mi) from downtown S\\u00e3o Paulo.\\n\\n## Car =The airport has its own highway system: Rodovia H\\u00e9lio Smidt Highway which connects the airport to Presidente Dutra Highway or Ayrton Senna Highway. Residents of Guarulhos can access the road via Monteiro Lobato Avenue. Taxi stands are located outside each of the two terminals on the Arrivals level; inside there are car rental agency representatives.\\n\\n## Bus =Bus transportation is available through the Airport Bus Service, an executive bus line, administered by EMTU and operated by Cons\\u00f3rcio Internorte \\u2013 \\u00c1rea 3. This service provides transportation connecting Guarulhos to Congonhas airport; to Tiet\\u00ea Bus Terminal; to Palmeiras-Barra Funda Intermodal Terminal, to Faria Lima Ave; To Republica Square (Pra\\u00e7a da Rep\\u00fablica); To Berrini Ave., Itaim Bibi district; and to the circuit of hotels along Paulista Avenue and Rua Augusta. The ride takes about one hour, depending on traffic. At the airport, tickets can be purchased at the counter located outside the lounge of the Terminal 1, Wing B&#x27;s arrivals level.\\nP\\u00e1ssaro Marron/EMTU, a syndicate of the Internorte Consortium, offers two regular bus lines, 257 and 299, connecting Tatuap\\u00e9 subway station (Line 3-Red) with Guarulhos Airport every 30 minutes. At Tatuap\\u00e9, both buses can be picked up on a platform of that multimodal station&#x27;s North side bus terminal. At the airport, the stop for both buses is at the Arrivals level road connecting the wings of Terminal 2.\\nGol Airlines and LATAM offer for their passengers free bus transfers between Guarulhos and Congonhas airports at regular times.\\nVia\\u00e7\\u00e3o Cometa offers daily departures to and from the airport and the cities of Santos, Sorocaba, S\\u00e3o Vicente, and Praia Grande. Lirabus operates daily buses between the airport and Campinas. P\\u00e1ssaro Marron offers bus services to S\\u00e3o Jos\\u00e9 dos Campos with departures every two hours. Via\\u00e7\\u00e3o Transdutra connects the airport with the city of Aruj\\u00e1.\\n\\n## Rail Line 13-Jade of the S\\u00e3o Paulo commuter rail system, operated by CPTM, connects with the airport through Aeroporto-Guarulhos Station. This line started its operations experimentally on March 31, 2018. The line was opened initially on a trial phase and operates only on Saturdays and Sundays from 10 a.m. to 3 p.m., with trains every 30 minutes to the suburban station of Engenheiro Goulart in eastern S\\u00e3o Paulo city, from where a further connection with CPTM&#x27;s line 12 and at least another one by subway will be necessary to reach downtown and the main business areas. Service will be expanded in May 2018 to seven days a week, but still only from 10 a.m. to 3 p.m. Full service from 4 a.m. to midnight is expected in late June 2018.\\n\\nAdditionally, since December 2020 there&#x27;s the Airport Express service, from Luz station to Aeroporto-Guarulhos, departing from each termini station every hour. It attends only one station towards Aeroporto-Guarulhos (Guarulhos-CECAP station), and 2 stations towards Luz (Guarulhos-CECAP and Br\\u00e1s).\\nAeroporto-Guarulhos station is opposite to Terminal 1, which is Guarulhos Airport&#x27;s smallest and least busy, and not linked to the other terminals except by a shuttle bus. The GRU Airport company reportedly vetoed a station closer to much busier Terminals 2 and 3 because it intended to build a shopping mall at the proposed location. The excessive number of train changes through crowded commuter rail and subway lines, and the added inconvenience of the requirement for a shuttle bus, has attracted criticism to the S\\u00e3o Paulo state government, responsible for S\\u00e3o Paulo&#x27;s subway and commuter rail systems, which has been accused of flawed planning and overindulgence with the airport&#x27;s private concessionaire.\\nTo solve this situation, Governor Jo\\u00e3o Doria and State Secretary of Metropolitan Transports Alexandre Baldy proposed a people mover to connect the CPTM station directly to the airport, estimated to be opened in May 2021. However, many delays prevented the construction of the line, which should be owned and fully operated by GRU Airport. In November 2020, the Brazilian federal government, through the Ministry of Infrastructure, authorized the construction of the people mover, which should cost R$ 175 million (approximately US$ 47.7 million in 2019).\\nIn December 2020 it was announced that Brazilian firm Aerom, which owns the Aeromovel technology, had been selected to install the system.  Construction was due to begin in January 2021 with completing in 2022.  In June 2021 it was announced that the project had &#x27;advanced&#x27; but a schedule for construction had not been finalised.\\n&quot;, &quot;images&quot;: [&quot;https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/9/97/AeroportoGuarulhos_Torre2.jpg&quot;, &quot;https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/b/b6/Aeroporto_de_Cumbica_-_Terminal_3.jpg&quot;, &quot;https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/0/0b/Aircraft_at_GRU_airport%2C_S%C3%A3o_Paulo_2017_06.jpg&quot;, &quot;https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/6/68/Aviacionavion.png&quot;], &quot;near&quot;: [], &quot;lat&quot;: -46.4716711, &quot;lon&quot;: -23.4302175, &quot;maps&quot;: &quot;https://www.google.com/maps/search/?api=1&amp;query=GRU%20Airport%20S%C3%A3o%20Paulo-Guarulhos%20Int%27l%20Airport%20%28GRU%29%20-%20Rod.%20H%C3%A9lio%20Smidt%2C%20s%2Fn%C2%BA%20-%20Aeroporto%2C%20Guarulhos%20-%20SP%2C%2007190-100%2C%20Brazil&quot;, &quot;citymapper&quot;: &quot;https://citymapper.com/directions?endcoord=-23.4302175,-46.4716711&amp;endname=GRU%20Airport&quot;, &quot;icon&quot;: &quot;https://img.icons8.com/?size=150&amp;id=dOcutZ26h8RF&quot;}\n",

In 2011, it was the ninth busiest airport in Latin America and the sixth busiest in South America by passenger traffic. It was the seventh busiest airport in Latin America by aircraft movements, serving 124,799 operations. Its location in Chile&#x27;s most populated area, as well as in the central part of the country, makes it an ideal main hub and maintenance center for most local airlines such as LATAM and Sky Airline. LATAM Airlines accounts for approximately 82% of the airport&#x27;s total commercial operations.\\nThe airport is owned by the Chilean government and has been operated since October 2015 by Nuevo Pudahuel, a consortium of companies formed by A\\u00e9roports de Paris (France), Vinci Airports (France) and Astaldi (Italy). Air traffic control is handled by the Directorate General of Civil Aviation. Its ICAO category is 4F. The airport functions as a joint civil-military facility. It is the headquarters of the Chilean Air Force 2nd Air Brigade and where its 10th Aviation Group is based.\\nSantiago International is the longest non-stop destination for most European carriers including Iberia, Air France, and British Airways from their respective hubs in Madrid\\u2013Barajas Airport, Paris\\u2013Charles de Gaulle, and London\\u2013Heathrow Airport. The airport is also Latin America&#x27;s main gateway to Oceania, with scheduled flights to Sydney, Melbourne, Auckland, and Easter Island.\\n\\n\\n## History \\n## Early years The demands of the growing metropolitan area of Santiago and the need for modern, jet-era airport facilities, which could safely accommodate both domestic and intercontinental flights, drove the need to relocate the Chilean capital&#x27;s principal airport from Los Cerrillos Airport (ICAO: SCTI; IATA: ULC) in the denser southwest metropolitan region of Santiago to the more rural northwest metropolitan area.\\nConstruction of the original terminal building, the eastern runway (17L/35R), control tower, east apron and cargo facilities commenced in 1961. On February 2, 1967, the airport was commissioned Aeropuerto Internacional de Pudahuel, due to its location in the municipality of Pudahuel. On March 19, 1980, the airport was rechristened Arturo Merino Ben\\u00edtez International Airport in honour of the founder of the Chilean Air Force and Chilean carrier LATAM Chile (Formerly Linea Aerea Nacional, LAN Chile).\\n\\n## 1994 expansion =The facility was expanded in 1994 with a new international terminal that covered 90,000 square meters, inspired by the architecture of Marseille Provence Airport in France. The building is located between the two parallel runways.\\nThis expansion added a new control tower, jetways, a duty-free zone, hotel, and greater parking area. The old terminal was used for domestic flights until 2001, when all passenger operations were merged into the same building.\\nIn 2000, Lan Chile joined Oneworld, making of Arturo Merino Benitez Airport a main hub for the alliance, its first one in Latin America and its second in the Southern Hemisphere (after Qantas&#x27; Sydney Kingsford Smith International Airport in Australia). As of April 2014, 71% of international and 75% of domestic passengers were carried by Oneworld member airlines.\\nDuring the 2010 Chile earthquake, the passenger terminal building suffered internal damages and the collapse of a pedestrian bridge between the vehicle ramp and the departures area. Nevertheless, both runways and control tower were unharmed, allowing the realization of a massive humanitarian air-bridge held by the Chilean Air Force to Concepci\\u00f3n, Chile (Carriel Sur International Airport), close to the most damaged area by this earthquake and subsequent tsunami. The airport authority had closed off all commercial flight operations after around 1200 UTC on February 27, resuming full operations on March 3, 2010.\\nIn 2011, IATA recognized the DGAC (Chile&#x27;s provider of air navigation services) and SCL (Santiago Airport) with the Exceptional Recognition Award to the cooperative efforts of SCL and DGAC Chile that facilitated a quick recovery from the devastation that followed the Chilean earthquake on 27 February 2010. \\&quot;Both airport and air navigation services were restored quickly with no impact on rates or charges for passengers or airlines. DGAC Chile and SCL are widely regarded as leaders in Latin America for efficiency, quality, and customer focus.\\n\\nIn June 2011, Santiago International Airport received the Air Cargo Excellence Award, as the best Latin American Cargo Airport.\\n\\n## Second runway =Construction on Runway 17R/35L began in 2004 and opened to traffic in September 2005. However, within months defects were discovered and the runway required repairing, completed in January 2006. Unfortunately further study of the problem discovered that the initial repairs were insufficient, needing additional work. Finally, 17R/35L reopened for traffic in March 2007.\\n\\n## 2020 master plan and expansion =In 2008, the airport terminal reached its maximum design capacity of 9.5 million annual passengers, two years earlier than forecast, and with the repairs needed after the 2010 Chile earthquake, the Ministry of Public Works announced in 2012 that it would call for proposals for the expansion and administration of the airport, two years prior to the end of the contract with the current operator.\\nThe ministry decided to investigate a new airport master plan instead of an expansion of the single passenger terminal building, as initially proposed by the current operator. The feasibility studies for this master plan cost 4,560 million Chilean pesos (US$9.4 million) considered in the 2011 fiscal budget.\\nFor this new master plan, the Government hired the consultancy services of A\\u00e9roports de Paris Ingeni\\u00e9rie (ADP-I), the architecture, engineering and technical branch of the French airport corporation.\\nThe master plan took into account a capacity growth to 14 million annual passengers by 2014, thirty-four million by year 2034 and 50 million passengers by 2045. New detached passenger terminal buildings for international and domestic flights, additional commercial areas and the construction of a light railway connecting the airport with the Santiago Metro network were considered.\\nIn June 2013, the Chilean Ministry of Public Works started Phase 1 of the airport expansion.\\nOn February 4, 2015, the consortium \\&quot;Nuevo Pudahuel\\&quot;, formed by French companies A\\u00e9roports de Paris (45%), Vinci Airports (40%) and Italian infrastructure company Astaldi (15%) won the bidding process to manage and develop the airport for 20 years since October 1, 2015. The main missions of the new administration will be \\&quot;the renovation of existing installations with the redesign and extension of the current terminal; the funding, design and construction of a new 175,000-square-meter terminal which will increase the airport&#x27;s capacity to 30 million passengers, with potential for expansion beyond 45 million; the operation and commercial development for the duration of the concession (20 years) of the main infrastructures: existing terminal and new terminals, car parks and future property developments. Building works will be executed by Astaldi (50% of conception-construction pool) and Vinci Construction Grands Projets (50%)\\&quot;.\\n\\n\\n## Facilities \\n## Terminal 1 \\u2013 domestic flights The terminal building, originally built for both domestic and international operations until 2021, has four levels:\\n\\nGround floor: Arrivals, duty-free shop, baggage claim, transport services, parking areas, hotel access.\\nFirst floor: Administrative offices, VIP lounges (access through the second floor).\\nSecond floor: Departures, check-in &amp; baggage drop off hall, shops, restaurants, boarding gates.\\nThird floor: Restaurants and VIP check-in areas (LATAM).\\nTerminal 1 hosts a bank office, Chilean Automobile Club, telecommunication companies (Claro, Movistar and Entel PCS), pharmacy, travel agencies, airlines offices, insurance offices and a police station (Carabineros de Chile).\\n\\n## Terminal 2 \\u2013 international flights =The new international terminal covers more than 200,000 square meters.
